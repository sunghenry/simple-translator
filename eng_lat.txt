The Latin language has always been held in very high esteem by the Catholic Church and by the Roman Pontiffs. They have assiduously encouraged the knowledge and dissemination of Latin, adopting it as the Church’s language, capable of passing on the Gospel message throughout the world. This is authoritatively stated by the Apostolic Constitution Veterum Sapientia of my Predecessor, Blessed John XXIII.
Latina Lingua permagni ab Ecclesia Catholica Romanisque Pontificibus usque est aestimata, quandoquidem ipsorum propria habita est lingua, qui eandem cognoscendam et diffundendam assidue curaverunt, cum Evangelii nuntium in universum orbem transmittere valeret, quemadmodum in Constitutione Apostolica Veterum sapientia Decessor Noster beatus Ioannes XXIII iure meritoque edixit.
Indeed the Church has spoken and prayed in the languages of all peoples since Pentecost. Nevertheless, the Christian communities of the early centuries made frequent use of Greek and Latin, languages of universal communication in the world in which they lived and through which the newness of Christ’s word encountered the heritage of the Roman-Hellenistic culture.
Enimvero inde a Pentecoste omnibus hominum linguis locuta et precata est Ecclesia. Attamen christianae communitates primorum saeculorum linguam Graecam Latinamque affatim usurpaverunt, cum illis locis in quibus morabantur universalia essent communicationis instrumenta, quorum ope Christi Verbi novitas hereditati obviam ivit Romani et Hellenistici cultus.
After the fall of the Roman Empire of the West, the Church of Rome not only continued to use Latin but, in a certain way, made herself its custodian and champion in both the theological and liturgical sectors as well as in formation and in the transmission of knowledge.
Romano Imperio occidentali exstincto, Romana Ecclesia non modo lingua Latina uti perrexit, verum etiam quodammodo custos eiusdem et fautrix fuit, sive in Theologiae ac Liturgiae, sive in institutionis et scientiae transmittendae provincia.

Those indignant winds grumble with a loud murmuring around the confines of the mountain; Aeolus sits in his high citadel, holding his scepter, and he soothes their spirits and tempers their rages: if he did not do this, they would surely snatch away seas and lands and the deep heaven itself, and sweep them off through the windy sky.

Ad quem tum Juno supplex his vocibus usa est: / "Aeole – namque tibi divum pater atque hominum rex / et mulcere dedit fluctus et tollere vento –, / gens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum navigat æquor, / Ilium in Italiam portans victosque Penates."

Aeolus spoke thus in reply: "It is yours, O queen, to express what you wish; my task is to obey your commands. You grant me control over this kingdom, such as it is, the scepters and Jupiter; you allow me to recline at the feasts of the gods, and to hold the power of the clouds and the storms."
Aeolus hæc contra: "Tuus, o regina, quid optes, / explorare labor, mihi jussa capessere fas est. / Tu mihi, quodcumque hoc regni, tu sceptra Jovemque / concilias, tu das epulis accumbere divum, / nimborumque facis tempestatumque potentem."
When he had said these things, he struck with reversed spear the side of the hollow mountain, and the winds, as a single column, race through the offered gate and blast the lands with a tornado.

Then fury spurred their courage, and behold, / As ravening wolves, when darkness hides the day, / Stung with mad fire of famine uncontrolled, / Prowl from their dens, and leave the whelps to stay, / With jaws athirst and gaping for the prey. / So to sure death, amid the darkness there, / Where swords, and spears, and foemen bar the way, / Into the centre of the town we fare. / Night with her shadowy cone broods o'er the vaulted air.
Sic animis juvenum furor additus. Inde, lupi ceu / raptores, atra in nebula, quos improba ventris / exegit cæcos rabies, catulique relicti / faucibus exspectant siccis, per tela, per hostes / vadimus haud dubiam in mortem, mediæque tenemus / urbis iter. Nox atra cava circumvolat umbra.
Then, like wolves ravening in a black fog, whom mad malice of hunger hath driven blindly forth, and their cubs left behind await with throats unslaked; through the weapons of the enemy we march to certain death, and hold our way straight into the town. Night's sheltering shadow flutters dark around us.
Sic animis juvenum furor additus. Inde, lupi ceu / raptores, atra in nebula, quos improba ventris / exegit cæcos rabies, catulique relicti / faucibus exspectant siccis, per tela, per hostes / vadimus haud dubiam in mortem, mediæque tenemus / urbis iter. Nox atra cava circumvolat umbra.
This too sometime we shall haply remember with delight.
Forsan et hæc olim meminisse iuvabit.
Of arms I sing, and of the man, whom Fate / first drove from Troy to the Lavinian shore.
Arma virumque cano, Trojæ qui primus ab oris / Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinjaque venit / litora.
Full many an evil, through the mindful hate / of cruel Juno, from the gods he bore, / much tost on earth and ocean.
Multum ille et terris jactatus et alto / vi superum sævæ memorem Junonis ob iram.
Yea, and more, / in war enduring, ere he built a home, / and his loved household-deities brought o'er / to Latium, whence the Latin people come, / whence rose the Alban sires, and walls of lofty Rome.
Multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem / inferretque deos Latio, genus unde Latinum / Albanique patres atque altæ moenia Romæ.
O Muse, assist me and inspire my song, / the various causes and the crimes relate, / for what affronted majesty, what wrong / to injured Godhead, what offence so great / Heaven's Queen resenting, with remorseless hate, / could one renowned for piety compel / to brave such troubles, and endure the weight / of toils so many and so huge. O tell / how can in heavenly minds such fierce resentment dwell?
Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine læso, / quidve dolens regina deum tot volvere casus / insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores / impulerit. Tantæne animis cœlestibus iræ?
There stood a city, fronting far away / the mouths of Tiber and Italia's shore, / a Tyrian settlement of olden day, / rich in all wealth, and trained to war's rough lore, / Carthage the name, by Juno loved before / all places, even Samos.
Urbs antiqua fuit – Tyrii tenuere coloni –, / Carthago, Italiam contra Tiberinaque longe / ostia, dives opum studiisque asperrima belli, / quam Juno fertur terris magis omnibus unam / posthabita coluisse Samo.
Here were shown / her arms, and here her chariot; evermore / e'en then this land she cherished as her own, / and here, should Fate permit, had planned a world-wide throne.
Hic illius arma, / hic currus fuit; hoc regnum dea gentibus esse, / si qua fata sinant, jam tum tenditque fovetque.
But she had heard, how men of Trojan seed / those Tyrian towers should level, how again / from these in time a nation should proceed, / wide-ruling, tyrannous in war, the bane / (so Fate was working) of the Libyan reign.
Progeniem sed enim Trojano a sanguine duci / audierat, Tyrias olim quæ verteret arces; / hinc populum late regem belloque superbum / venturum excidio Libyæ: sic volvere Parcas.
This feared she, mindful of the war beside / waged for her Argives on the Trojan plain; / nor even yet had from her memory died / the causes of her wrath, the pangs of wounded pride.
Id metuens veterisque memor Saturnia belli, / prima quod ad Trojam pro caris gesserat Argis – / necdum etiam causæ irarum sævique dolores / exciderant animo.
The choice of Paris, and her charms disdained, / the hateful race, the lawless honours ta'en / by ravished Ganymede – these wrongs remained.
Manet alta mente repostum / judicium Paridis spretæque injuria formæ, / et genus invisum, et rapti Ganymedis honores.
So fired with rage, the Trojans' scanty train / by fierce Achilles and the Greeks unslain / she barred from Latium, and in evil strait / for many a year, on many a distant main / they wandered, homeless outcasts, tost by fate.
His accensa super, jactatos æquore toto / Troas, reliquias Danaum atque immitis Achilli, / arcebat longe Latio; multosque per annos / errabant acti fatis maria omnia circum.
So huge, so hard the task to found the Roman state.
Tantæ molis erat Romanam condere gentem!
Scarce out of sight of Sicily, they set / their sails to sea, and merrily ploughed the main, / with brazen beaks, when Juno, harbouring yet / within her breast the ever-ranking pain, / mused thus: "Must I then from the work refrain, / nor keep this Trojan from the Latin throne, / baffled, forsooth, because the Fates constrain?"
Vix e conspectu Siculæ telluris in altum / vela dabant læti et spumas salis ære ruebant, / cum Juno, æternum servans sub pectore vulnus, / hæc secum: "Mene incepto desistere victam, / nec posse Italia Teucrorum avertere regem! / Quippe vetor fatis."
He doesn't have a family.
Is familiam non habet.
"Could Pallas burn the Grecian fleet, and drown / their crews, for one man's crime, Oileus' frenzied son?"
"Pallasne exurere classem / Argivum atque ipsos potuit submergere ponto / unius ob noxam et furias Ajacis Oilei?"
"She, hurling Jove's winged lightning, stirred the deep / and strewed the ships. Him, from his riven breast / the flames outgasping, with a whirlwind's sweep / she caught and fixed upon a rock's sharp crest."
"Ipsa, Jovis rapidum jaculata e nubibus ignem, / disjecitque rates evertitque æquora ventis; / illum exspirantem transfixo pectore flammas / turbine corripuit, scopuloque infixit acuto."
"But I, who walk the Queen of Heaven confessed, / Jove's sister-spouse, shall I forevermore / with one poor tribe keep warring without rest? / Who then henceforth shall Juno's power adore? / Who then her fanes frequent, her deity implore?"
"Ast ego, quæ divum incedo regina, Jovisque / et soror et conjux, una cum gente tot annos / bella gero! Et quisquam numen Junonis adorat / præterea, aut supplex aris imponet honorem?"
Such thoughts revolving in her fiery mind, / straightway the Goddess to AEolia passed, / the storm-clouds' birthplace, big with blustering wind.
Talia flammato secum dea corde volutans, / nimborum in patriam, loca feta furentibus Austris, / Aeoliam venit.
Here AEolus within a dungeon vast / the sounding tempest and the struggling blast / bends to his sway and bridles them with chains.
Hic vasto rex Aeolus antro / luctantes ventos tempestatesque sonoras / imperio premit, ac vinclis et carcere frenat.
They, in the rock reverberant held fast, / moan at the doors. Here, throned aloft, he reigns; / his sceptre calms their rage, their violence restrains: / else earth and sea and all the firmament / the winds together through the void would sweep.
Illi indignantes, magno cum murmure montis, / circum claustra fremunt; celsa sedet Aeolus arce, / sceptra tenens, mollitque animos et temperat iras: / ni faciat, maria ac terras cœlumque profundum / quippe ferant rapidi secum verrantque per auras.
But, fearing this, the Sire omnipotent / hath buried them in caverns dark and deep, / and o'er them piled huge mountains in a heap, / and set withal a monarch, there to reign, / by compact taught at his command to keep / strict watch, and tighten or relax the rein.
Sed pater omnipotens speluncis abdidit atris, / hoc metuens, molemque et montes insuper altos / imposuit, regemque dedit, qui fœdere certo / et premere et laxas sciret dare jussus habenas.
Him now Saturnia sought, and thus in lowly strain: / "O AEolus, for Jove, of human kind / and Gods the sovran Sire, hath given to thee / to lull the waves and lift them with the wind, / a hateful people, enemies to me, / their ships are steering o'er the Tuscan sea, / bearing their Troy and vanquished gods away / to Italy."
Ad quem tum Juno supplex his vocibus usa est: / "Aeole – namque tibi divum pater atque hominum rex / et mulcere dedit fluctus et tollere vento –, / gens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum navigat æquor, / Ilium in Italiam portans victosque Penates."
The restaurant where we ate lunch was very crowded.
Caupona in qua prandimus frequentissima erat.
Tom is lying.
Thomas mentitur.
"Go, set the storm-winds free, / and sink their ships or scatter them astray, / and strew their corpses forth, to weltering waves a prey."
"Incute vim ventis submersasque obrue puppes, / aut age diversos et disjice corpora ponto."
"Twice seven nymphs have I, beautiful to see; / one, Deiopeia, fairest of the fair, / in lasting wedlock will I link to thee, / thy life-long years for such deserts to share, / and make thee parent of an offspring fair."
"Sunt mihi bis septem præstanti corpore Nymphæ, / quarum, quæ forma pulcherrima Deïopea, / connubio jungam stabili propriamque dicabo, / omnes ut tecum meritis pro talibus annos / exigat, et pulchra faciat te prole parentem."
"Speak, Queen," he answered, "to obey is mine. / To thee I owe this sceptre and whate'er / of realm is here; thou makest Jove benign, / thou giv'st to rule the storms and sit at feasts divine."
Aeolus hæc contra: "Tuus, o regina, quid optes, / explorare labor, mihi jussa capessere fas est. / Tu mihi, quodcumque hoc regni, tu sceptra Jovemque / concilias, tu das epulis accumbere divum, / nimborumque facis tempestatumque potentem."
So spake the God and with her hest complied, / and turned the massive sceptre in his hand / and pushed the hollow mountain on its side. / Out rushed the winds, like soldiers in a band, / in wedged array, and, whirling, scour the land.
Hæc ubi dicta, cavum conversa cuspide montem / impulit in latus, ac venti, velut agmine facto, / qua data porta, ruunt et terras turbine perflant.
East, West and squally South-west, with a roar, / swoop down on Ocean, and the surf and sand / mix in dark eddies, and the watery floor / heave from its depths, and roll huge billows to the shore. / Then come the creak of cables and the cries / of seamen.
Incubuere mari, totumque a sedibus imis / una Eurusque Notusque ruunt creberque procellis / Africus, et vastos volvunt ad litora fluctus. / Insequitur clamorque virum stridorque rudentum.
Clouds the darkened heavens have drowned, / and snatched the daylight from the Trojans' eyes. / Black night broods on the waters; all around / from pole to pole the rattling peals resound / and frequent flashes light the lurid air. / All nature, big with instant ruin, frowned / destruction.
Eripiunt subito nubes cœlumque diemque / Teucrorum ex oculis: ponto nox incubat atra; / intonuere poli, et crebris micat ignibus æther, / præsentemque viris intentant omnia mortem.
Then AEneas' limbs with fear / were loosened, and he groaned and stretched his hands in prayer. / "Thrice, four times blest, who, in their fathers' face / fell by the walls of Ilion far away!"
Extemplo Aeneæ solvuntur frigore membra; / ingemit et, duplices tendens ad sidera palmas, / talia voce refert: "O terque quaterque beati, / quis ante ora patrum Trojæ sub mœnibus altis / contigit oppetere!"
"O son of Tydeus, bravest of the race, / why could not I have perished, too, that day / beneath thine arm, and breathed this soul away / far on the plains of Troy, where Hector brave / lay, pierced by fierce AEacide, where lay / giant Sarpedon, and swift Simois' wave / rolls heroes, helms and shields, whelmed in one watery grave?"
"O Danaum fortissime gentis / Tydide! Mene Iliacis occumbere campis / non potuisse, tuaque animam hanc effundere dextra, / sævus ubi Aeacidæ telo jacet Hector, ubi ingens / Sarpedon, ubi tot Simois correpta sub undis / scuta virum galeasque et fortia corpora volvit!"
E'en as he cried, the hurricane from the North / struck with a roar against the sail. Up leap / the waves to heaven.
Talia jactanti stridens Aquilone procella / velum adversa ferit, fluctusque ad sidera tollit.
The shattered oars start forth; / round swings the prow, and lets the waters sweep / the broadside. Onward comes a mountain heap / of billows, gaunt, abrupt.
Franguntur remi; tum prora avertit et undis / dat latus; insequitur cumulo præruptus aquæ mons.
These, horsed astride / a surge's crest, rock pendent o'er the deep; / to those the wave's huge hollow, yawning wide, / lays bare the ground below; dark swells the sandy tide.
Hi summo in fluctu pendent, his unda dehiscens / terram inter fluctus aperit; furit æstus arenis.
Three ships the South-wind catching hurls away / on hidden rocks, which (Latins from of yore / have called them "Altars") in mid ocean lay, / a huge ridge level with the tide.
Tres Notus abreptas in saxa latentia torquet – / saxa vocant Itali, mediis quæ in fluctibus, Aras; / dorsum immane mari summo.
Three more / fierce Eurus from the deep sea dashed ashore / on quicks and shallows, pitiful to view, / and round them heaped the sandbanks.
Tres Eurus ab alto / in brevia et syrtes urget – miserabile visu –, / illiditque vadis atque aggere cingit arenæ.
One, that bore / the brave Orontes and his Lycian crew, / full in AEneas' sight a toppling wave o'erthrew. / Dashed from the tiller, down the pilot rolled. / Thrice round the billow whirled her, as she lay, / then whelmed below.
Unam, quæ Lycios fidumque vehebat Oronten, / ipsius ante oculos ingens a vertice pontus / in puppim ferit: excutitur pronusque magister / volvitur in caput, ast illam ter fluctus ibidem / torquet agens circum et rapidus vorat æquore vortex.
Now fail the ships wherein Achates ride / and Abas; old Aletes' bark gives way, / and brave Ilioneus'. Each loosened side / through many a gaping seam lets in the baleful tide.
Jam validam Ilionei navem, jam fortis Achatæ, / et qua vectus Abas, et qua grandævus Aletes, / vicit hiems: laxis laterum compagibus omnes / accipiunt inimicum imbrem rimisque fatiscunt.
Strewn here and there behold / arms, planks, lone swimmers in the surges grey, / and treasures snatched from Trojan homes away.
Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto, / arma virum tabulæque et Troja gaza per undas.
Meanwhile great Neptune, sore amazed, perceived / the storm let loose, the turmoil of the sky, / and ocean from its lowest depths upheaved. / With calm brow lifted o'er the sea, his eye...
Interea magno misceri murmure pontum, / emissamque hiemem sensit Neptunus et imis / stagna refusa vadis, graviter commotus; et alto / prospiciens, summa placidum caput extulit unda.
... beholds Troy's navy scattered far and nigh, / and by the waves and ruining heaven oppressed / the Trojan crews. Nor failed he to espy / his sister's wiles and hatred.
Disjectam Aeneæ toto videt æquore classem, / fluctibus oppressos Troas cœlique ruina; / nec latuere doli fratrem Junonis et iræ.
East and West / he summoned to his throne, and thus his wrath expressed. / "What pride of birth possessed you, Earth and air / without my leave to mingle in affray, / and raise such hubbub in my realm?"
Eurum ad se Zephyrumque vocat, dehinc talia fatur: / "Tantæne vos generis tenuit fiducia vestri? / Jam cœlum terramque meo sine numine, Venti, / miscere et tantas audetis tollere moles?"
"Beware... / Yet first 'twere best these billows to allay. / Far other coin hereafter ye shall pay / for crimes like these."
"Quos ego... sed motos præstat componere fluctus. / Post mihi non simili pœna commissa luetis."
"Presumptuous winds, begone, / and take your king this message, that the sway / of Ocean and the sceptre and the throne / Fate gave to me, not him; the trident is my own."
"Maturate fugam, regique hæc dicite vestro: / non illi imperium pelagi sævumque tridentem, / sed mihi sorte datum."
"He holds huge rocks; these, Eurus, are for thee, / there let him glory in his hall and reign, / but keep his winds close prisoners."
"Tenet ille immania saxa, / vestras, Eure, domos; illa se jactet in aula / Aeolus, et clauso ventorum carcere regnet."
Thus he, / and, ere his speech was ended, smoothed the main, / and chased the clouds and brought the sun again.
Sic ait, et dicto citius tumida æquora placat, / collectasque fugat nubes solemque reducit.
Triton, Cymothoe from the rock's sharp brow / push off the vessels. Neptune plies amain / his trident-lever, lays the sandbanks low, / on light wheels shaves the deep, and calms the billowy flow.
Cymothoë simul et Triton annixus acuto / detrudunt naves scopulo; levat ipse tridenti, / et vastas aperit Syrtes, et temperat æquor, / atque rotis summas levibus perlabitur undas.
As when in mighty multitudes bursts out / sedition, and the wrathful rabble rave; / rage finds them arms; stones, firebrands fly about.
Ac veluti magno in populo cum sæpe coorta est / seditio, sævitque animis ignobile vulgus / jamque faces et saxa volant, furor arma ministrat.
Then if some statesman reverend and grave, / stand forth conspicuous, and the tumult brave / all, hushed, attend; his guiding words restrain / their angry wills.
Tum, pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem / conspexere, silent arrectisque auribus adstant; / ille regit dictis animos et pectora mulcet.
So sank the furious wave, / when through the clear sky looking o'er the main, / the sea-king lashed his steeds and slacked the favouring rein.
Sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor, æquora postquam / prospiciens genitor, cœloque invectus aperto, / flectit equos, curruque volans dat lora secundo.
Tired out, the Trojans seek the nearest land / and turn to Libya.
Defessi Aeneadæ, quæ proxima litora, cursu / contendunt petere, et Libyæ vertuntur ad oras.
In a far retreat / there lies a haven; towards the deep doth stand / an island, on whose jutting headlands beat / the broken billows, shivered into sleet.
Est in secessu longo locus: insula portum / efficit objectu laterum, quibus omnis ab alto / frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos.
Two towering crags, twin giants, guard the cove, / and threat the skies. The waters at their feet / sleep hushed, and, like a curtain, frowns above, / mixt with the glancing green, the darkness of the grove.
Hinc atque hinc vastæ rupes geminique minantur / in cœlum scopuli, quorum sub vertice late / æquora tuta silent; tum silvis scena coruscis / desuper horrentique atrum nemus imminet umbra.
Beneath a precipice, that fronts the wave, / with limpid springs inside, and many a seat / of living marble, lies a sheltered cave, / home of the Sea-Nymphs. In this haven sweet / cable nor biting anchor moors the fleet.
Fronte sub adversa scopulis pendentibus antrum; / intus aquæ dulces vivoque sedilia saxo, / Nympharum domus. Hic fessas non vincula naves / ulla tenent, unco non alligat ancora morsu.
Here with seven ships, the remnant of his band, / AEneas enters. Glad at length to greet / the welcome earth, the Trojans leap to land, / and lay their weary limbs still dripping on the sand.
Huc septem Aeneas collectis navibus omni / ex numero subit, ac magno telluris amore / egressi optata potiuntur Troes arena, / et sale tabentes artus in litore ponunt.
First from a flint a spark Achates drew, / and lit the leaves and dry wood heaped with care / and set the fuel flaming, as he blew.
Ac primum silici scintillam excudit Achates, / suscepitque ignem foliis, atque arida circum / nutrimenta dedit rapuitque in fomite flammam.
Then, tired of toiling, from the ships they bear / the sea-spoiled corn, and Ceres' tools prepare, / and 'twixt the millstones grind the rescued grain / and roast the pounded morsels for their fare.
Tum Cererem corruptam undis Cerealiaque arma / expediunt fessi rerum, frugesque receptas / et torrere parant flammis et frangere saxo.
While up the crag AEneas climbs, to gain / full prospect far and wide, and scan the distant main. / If aught of Phrygian biremes he discern / Antheus or Capys, tost upon the seas, / or arms of brave Caicus high astern.
Aeneas scopulum interea conscendit et omnem / prospectum late pelago petit, Anthea si quem / jactatum vento videat Phrygiasque biremes, / aut Capyn, aut celsis in puppibus arma Caici.
No sail, but wandering on the shore he sees / three stags, and, grazing up the vale at ease, / the whole herd troops behind them in a row.
Navem in conspectu nullam, tres litore cervos / prospicit errantes; hos tota armenta sequuntur / a tergo, et longum per valles pascitur agmen.
He stops, and from Achates hastes to seize / his chance-brought arms, the arrows and the bow, / the branching antlers smites, and lays the leader low. / Next fall the herd; and through the leafy glade / in mingled rout he drives the scattered train, / plying his shafts.
Constitit hic, arcumque manu celeresque sagittas / corripuit, fidus quæ tela gerebat Achates, / ductoresque ipsos primum, capita alta ferentes / cornibus arboreis, sternit, tum vulgus, et omnem / miscet agens telis nemora inter frondes turbam.
Nor stays his conquering raid / till seven huge bodies on the ground lie slain, / the number of his vessels; then again / he seeks the crews, and gives a deer to each.
Nec prius absistit, quam septem ingentia victor / corpora fundat humi et numerum cum navibus æquet. / Hinc portum petit, et socios partitur in omnes.
Then opes the casks, which good Acestes, fain / at parting, filled on the Trinacrian beach, / and shares the wine, and soothes their drooping hearts with speech.
Vina bonus quæ deinde cadis onerarat Acestes / litore Trinacrio dederatque abeuntibus heros, / dividit, et dictis mærentia pectora mulcet:
"Comrades! of ills not ignorant; far more / than these ye suffered, and to these as well / will Jove give ending, as he gave before."
"O socii (neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum), / o passi graviora, dabit deus his quoque finem".
"Ye know mad Scylla, and her monsters' yell, / and the dark caverns where the Cyclops dwell."
"Vos et Scyllæam rabiem penitusque sonantes / accestis scopulos, vos et Cyclopia saxa / experti".
"Fear not; take heart; hereafter, it may be / these too will yield a pleasant tale to tell."
"Revocate animos, mæstumque timorem / mittite; forsan et hæc olim meminisse juvabit".
"Through shifting hazards, by the Fates' decree, / to Latin shores we steer, our promised land to see. / There quiet settlements the Fates display, / there Troy her ruined fortunes shall repair. / Bear up; reserve you for a happier day."
"Per varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum / tendimus in Latium, sedes ubi fata quietas / ostendunt; illic fas regna resurgere Trojæ. / Durate et vosmet rebus servate secundis".
He spake, and heart-sick with a load of care, / suppressed his grief, and feigned a cheerful air.
Talia voce refert curisque ingentibus æger / spem vultu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem.
All straightway gird them to the feast. These flay / the ribs and thighs, and lay the entrails bare. / Those slice the flesh, and split the quivering prey, / and tend the fires and set the cauldrons in array.
Illi se prædæ accingunt dapibusque futuris: / tergora deripiunt costis et viscera nudant; / pars in frusta secant veribusque trementia figunt; / litore aëna locant alii flammasque ministrant.
So wine and venison, to their hearts' desire, / refreshed their strength.
Tum victu revocant vires, fusique per herbam / implentur veteris Bacchi pinguisque ferinæ.
And when the feast was sped, / their missing friends in converse they require, / doubtful to deem them, betwixt hope and dread, / alive or out of hearing with the dead.
Postquam exempta fames epulis mensæque remotæ, / amissos longo socios sermone requirunt, / spemque metumque inter dubii, seu vivere credant, / sive extrema pati nec jam exaudire vocatos.
All mourned, but good AEneas mourned the most, / and bitter tears for Amycus he shed, / Gyas, Cloanthus, bravest of his host, / Lycus, Orontes bold, all counted with the lost.
Præcipue pius Aeneas nunc acris Oronti, / nunc Amyci casum gemit et crudelia secum / fata Lyci fortemque Gyan fortemque Cloanthum.
Now came an end of mourning and of woe, / when Jove, surveying from his prospect high / shore, sail-winged sea, and peopled earth below, / stood, musing, on the summit of the sky, / and on the Libyan kingdom fixed his eye.
Et jam finis erat, cum Jupiter, æthere summo / despiciens mare velivolum terrasque jacentes / litoraque et latos populos, sic vertice cœli / constitit et Libyæ defixit lumina regnis.
To him, such cares revolving in his breast, / her shining eyes suffused with tears, came nigh / fair Venus, for her darling son distrest, / and thus in sorrowing tones the Sire of heaven addressed.
Atque illum, tales jactantem pectore curas, / tristior et lacrimis oculos suffusa nitentes / alloquitur Venus:
"O Thou, whose nod and awful bolts attest / o'er Gods and men thine everlasting reign, / wherein hath my AEneas so transgressed, / wherein his Trojans, thus to mourn their slain, / barred from the world, lest Italy they gain?"
"O qui res hominumque deumque / æternis regis imperiis et fulmine terres, / quid meus Aeneas in te committere tantum, / quid Troes potuere, quibus tot funera passis, / cunctus ob Italiam terrarum clauditur orbis?"
"Surely from them the rolling years should see / new sons of ancient Teucer rise again, / the Romans, rulers of the land and sea. / So swar'st thou; Father, say, why changed is thy decree?"
"Certe hinc Romanos olim, volventibus annis, / hinc fore ductores, revocato a sanguine Teucri, / qui mare, qui terras omni dicione tenerent, / pollicitus, quæ te, genitor, sententia vertit?"
"That word consoled me, weighing fate with fate, / for Troy's sad fall. Now Fortune, as before, / pursues the woe-worn victims of her hate. / O when, great Monarch, shall their toil be o'er?"
"Hoc equidem occasum Trojæ tristesque ruinas / solabar, fatis contraria fata rependens; / nunc eadem fortuna viros tot casibus actos / insequitur. Quem das finem, rex magne, laborum?"
Tom wants to go with you.
Thomas vult tecum ire.
"Safe could Antenor pass th' Illyrian shore / through Danaan hosts, and realms Liburnian gain, / and climb Timavus and her springs explore, / where through nine mouths, with roaring surge, the main / bursts from the sounding rocks and deluges the plain."
"Antenor potuit, mediis elapsus Achivis, / Illyricos penetrare sinus atque intima tutus / regna Liburnorum et fontem superare Timavi, / unde per ora novem vasto cum murmure montis / it mare proruptum et pelago premit arva sonanti".
"Yet there he built Patavium, yea, and named / the nation, and the Trojan arms laid down, / and now rests happy in the town he framed."
"Hic tamen ille urbem Patavi sedesque locavit / Teucrorum, et genti nomen dedit armaque fixit / Troja; nunc placida compostus pace quiescit".
"But we, thy progeny, to whom alone / thy nod hath promised a celestial throne, / our vessels lost, from Italy are barred, / o shame! and ruined for the wrath of one. / Thus, thus dost thou thy plighted word regard, / our sceptred realms restore, our piety reward?"
"Nos, tua progenies, cœli quibus annuis arcem, / navibus (infandum!) amissis, unius ob iram / prodimur atque Italis longe disjungimur oris. / Hic pietatis honos? Sic nos in sceptra reponis?"
Then Jove, soft-smiling with the look that clears / the storms, and gently kissing her, replies.
Olli subridens hominum sator atque deorum, / vultu, quo cœlum tempestatesque serenat, / oscula libavit natæ, dehinc talia fatur:
"Firm are thy fates, sweet daughter; spare thy fears. / Thou yet shalt see Lavinium's walls arise, / and bear thy brave AEneas to the skies. / My purpose shifts not."
"Parce metu, Cytherea: manent immota tuorum / fata tibi; cernes urbem et promissa Lavini / mœnia, sublimemque feres ad sidera cœli / magnanimum Aenean, neque me sententia vertit".
"Now, to ease thy woes, / since sorrow for his sake hath dimmed thine eyes, / more will I tell, and hidden fates disclose. / He in Italia long shall battle with his foes, / and crush fierce tribes, and milder ways ordain, / and cities build and wield the Latin sway, / till the third summer shall have seen him reign, / and three long winter-seasons passed away / since fierce Rutulia did his arms obey."
"Hic – tibi fabor enim, quando hæc te cura remordet, / longius et volvens fatorum arcana movebo – / bellum ingens geret Italia, populosque feroces / contundet, moresque viris et mœnia ponet, / tertia dum Latio regnantem viderit æstas, / ternaque transierint Rutulis hiberna subactis".
"Then, too, the boy Ascanius, named of late / Iulus (Ilus was he in the day / when firm by royalty stood Ilium's state) / shall rule till thirty years complete the destined date. / He from Lavinium shall remove his seat, / and gird Long Alba for defence."
"At puer Ascanius, cui cognomen Iulo / additur (Ilus erat, dum res stetit Ilia regno), / triginta magnos volvendis mensibus orbes / imperio explebit, regnumque ab sede Lavini / transferet, et Longam multa vi muniet Albam".
"And there / 'neath Hector's kin three hundred years complete / the kingdom shall endure, till Ilia fair, / queen-priestess, twins by Mars' embrace shall bear."
"Hic jam ter centum totos regnabitur annos / gente sub Hectorea, donec regina sacerdos / Marte gravis geminam partu dabit Ilia prolem".
"Then Romulus the nation's charge shall claim, / wolf-nursed and proud her tawny hide to wear, / and build a city of Mavortian fame, / and make the Roman race remembered by his name. / To these no period nor appointed date, / nor bounds to their dominion I assign; / an endless empire shall the race await."
"Inde lupæ fulvo nutricis tegmine lætus / Romulus excipiet gentem et Mavortia condet / mœnia, Romanosque suo de nomine dicet. / His ego nec metas rerum nem tempora pono: / imperium sine fine dedi".
"Nay, Juno, too, who now, in mood malign, / earth, sea and sky is harrying, shall incline / to better counsels, and unite with me / to cherish and uphold the imperial line, / the Romans, rulers of the land and sea, / lords of the flowing gown. So standeth my decree."
"Quin aspera Juno, / quæ mare nunc terrasque metu cœlumque fatigat, / consilia in melius referet, mecumque fovebit / Romanos, rerum dominos gentemque togatam: / sic placitum".
"In rolling ages there shall come the day / when heirs of old Assaracus shall tame / Phthia and proud Mycene to obey, / and terms of peace to conquered Greeks proclaim."
"Veniet lustris labentibus ætas, / cum domus Assaraci Phthiam clarasque Mycenas / servitio premet ac victis dominabitur Argis".
"Caesar, a Trojan – Julius his name, / drawn from the great Iulus –, shall arise, / and compass earth with conquest, heaven with fame."
"Nascetur pulchra Trojanus origine Cæsar, / imperium oceano, famam qui terminet astris, / Julius, a magno demissum nomen Iulo".
"Him, crowned with vows and many an Eastern prize, / thou, freed at length from care, shalt welcome to the skies."
"Hunc tu olim cœlo, spoliis Orientis onustum, / accipies secura; vocabitur hic quoque votis".
"Then wars shall cease and savage times grow mild, / and Remus and Quirinus, brethren twain, / with hoary Faith and Vesta undefiled, / shall give the law. With iron bolt and chain / firm-closed the gates of Janus shall remain. / Within, the Fiend of Discord, high reclined / on horrid arms, unheeded in the fane, / bound with a hundred brazen knots behind, / and grim with gory jaws, his grisly teeth shall grind."
"Aspera tum positis mitescent sæcula bellis; / cana Fides, et Vesta, Remo cum fratre Quirinus, / jura dabunt; diræ ferro et compagibus artis / claudentur Belli portæ; Furor impius intus, / sæva sedens super arma, et centum vinctus aënis / post tergum nodis, fremet horridus ore cruento".
So saying, the son of Maia down he sent, / to open Carthage and the Libyan state, / lest Dido, weetless of the Fates' intent, / should drive the Trojan wanderers from her gate.
Hæc ait et Maia genitum demittit ab alto, / ut terræ utque novæ pateant Carthaginis arces / hospitio Teucris, ne fati nescia Dido / finibus arceret.
With feathered oars he cleaves the skies, and straight / on Libya's shores alighting, speeds his hest.
Volat ille per aëra magnum / remigio alarum ac Libyæ citus adstitit oris.
Wait until tomorrow.
Exspecta donec cras.
The Tyrians, yielding to the god, abate / their fierceness. Dido, more than all the rest, / warms to her Phrygian friends, and wears a kindly breast.
Et jam jussa facit, ponuntque ferocia Pœni / corda volente deo; in primis regina quietum / accipit in Teucros animum mentemque benignam.
But good AEneas, pondering through the night / distracting thoughts and many an anxious care, / resolved, when daybreak brought the gladsome light, / to search the coast, and back sure tidings bear, / what land was this, what habitants were there, / if man or beast, for, far as the eye could rove, / a wilderness the region seemed, and bare.
At pius Aeneas, per noctem plurima volvens, / ut primum lux alma data est, exire locosque / explorare novos, quas vento accesserit oras, / qui teneant, nam inculta videt, hominesne feræne, / quærere constituit, sociisque exacta referre.
His ships he hides within a sheltering cove, / screened by the caverned rock, and shadowed by the grove, / then wielding in his hand two broad-tipt spears, / alone with brave Achates forth he strayed.
Classem in convexo nemorum sub rupe cavata / arboribus clausam circum atque horrentibus umbris / occulit; ipse uno graditur comitatus Achate, / bina manu lato crispans hastilia ferro.
When lo, before him in the wood appears / his mother, in a virgin's arms arrayed, / in form and habit of a Spartan maid, / or like Harpalyce, the pride of Thrace, / who tires swift steeds, and scours the woodland glade, / and outstrips rapid Hebrus in the race. / So fair the goddess seemed, apparelled for the chase.
Cui mater media sese tulit obvia silva, / virginis os habitumque gerens et virginis arma / Spartanæ, vel qualis equos Threissa fatigat / Harpalyce volucremque fuga prævertitur Hebrum.
Bare were her knees, and from her shoulders hung / the wonted bow, kept handy for the prey / her flowing raiment in a knot she strung, / and loosed her tresses with the winds to play.
Namque humeris de more habilem suspenderat arcum / venatrix dederatque comam diffundere ventis, / nuda genu nodoque sinus collecta fluentes.
"Ho, Sirs!" she hails them, "saw ye here astray / ought of my sisters, girt in huntress wise / with quiver and a spotted lynx-skin gay, / or following on the foaming boar with cries?"
Ac prior, "Heus", inquit, "juvenes, monstrate mearum / vidistis si quam hic errantem forte sororum, / succintam pharetra et maculosæ tegmine lyncis, / aut spumantis apri cursum clamore prementem".
Thus Venus spake, and thus fair Venus' son replies: / "Nought of thy sisters have I heard or seen. / What name, O maiden, shall I give to thee, / for mortal never had thy voice or mien? / O Goddess surely, whether Nymph I see, / or Phoebus' sister."
Sic Venus, et Veneris contra sic filius orsus: / "Nulla tuarum audita mihi neque visa sororum, / o – quam te memorem, virgo? namque haud tibi vultus / mortalis, nec vox hominem sonat. O dea certe, / an Phœbi soror? an Nympharum sanguinis una?"
"Whosoe'er thou be, / be kind, for strangers and in evil case / we roam, tost hither by the stormy sea."
"Sis felix, nostrumque leves, quæcumque, laborem, / et, quo sub cœlo tandem, quibus orbis in oris / jactemur, doceas".
"Say, who the people, what the clime and place, / and many a victim's blood thy hallowed shrine shall grace."
"Ignari hominumque locorumque / erramus, vento huc vastis et fluctibus acti. / Multa tibi ante aras nostra cadet hostia dextra".
"Nay, nay, to no such honour I aspire." / Said Venus, "But a simple maid am I, / and 'tis the manner of the maids of Tyre / to wear, like me, the quiver, and to tie / the purple buskin round the ankles high."
Tum Venus: "Haud equidem tali me dignor honore; / virginibus Tyriis mos est gestare pharetram / purpureoque alte suras vincire cothurno".
"The realm thou see'st is Punic; Tyrians are / the folk, the town Agenor's. Round them lie / the Libyan plains, a people rough in war."
"Punica regna vides, Tyrios et Agenoris urbem; / sed fines Libyci, genus intractabile bello".
"Queen Dido rules the land, who came from Tyre afar, / flying her brother. Dark the tale of crime, / and long, but briefly be the sum supplied."
"Imperium Dido Tyria regit urbe profecta, / germanum fugiens. Longa est injuria, longæ / ambages; sed summa sequar fastigia rerum".
"Sychaeus was her lord, in happier time / the richest of Phoenicians far and wide / in land, and worshipped by his hapless bride. / Her, in the bloom of maidenhood, her sire / had given him, and with virgin rites allied."
"Huic conjux Sychæus erat, ditissimus agri / Phœnicum et magno miseræ dilectus amore, / cui pater intactam dederat primisque jugarat / ominibus".
"But soon her brother filled the throne of Tyre, / Pygmalion, swoln with sin."
"Sed regna Tyri germanus habebat / Pygmalion, scelere ante alios immanior omnes".
" 'twixt whom a feud took fire. / He, reckless of a sister's love, and blind / with lust of gold, Sychaeus unaware / slew by the altar, and with impious mind / long hid the deed, and flattering hopes and fair / devised, to cheat the lover of her care."
"Quos inter medius venit furor: ille Sychæum / impius ante aras atque auri cæcus amore / clam ferro incautum superat, securus amorum / germanæ, factumque diu celavit et ægram, / multa malus simulans, vana spe lusit amantem".
"But, lifting features marvellously pale, / the ghost unburied in her dreams laid bare / his breast, and showed the altar and the bale / wrought by the ruthless steel, and solved the crime's dark tale."
"Ipsa sed in somnis inhumati venit imago / conjugis, ora modis attollens pallida miris, / crudeles aras trajectaque pectora ferro / nudavit, cæcumque domus scelus omne retexit".
She writes Chinese.
Sinice scribit.
"Then bade her fly the country, and revealed, / to aid her flight, an old and unknown weight / of gold and silver, in the ground concealed."
"Tum celerare fugam patriaque excedere suadet / auxiliumque viæ veteres tellure recludit / thesauros, ignotum argenti pondus et auri".
I hope they arrive soon.
Spero eos mox perventuros esse.
I don't want to go outside this afternoon.
Nolo exire hodie post meridiem.
"Thus roused, her friends she gathers. All await / her summons, who the tyrant fear or hate. / Some ships at hand, chance-anchored in the bay / they seize and load them with the costly freight, / and far off o'er the deep is borne away / Pygmalion's hoarded pelf. A woman leads the way."
"His commota fugam Dido sociosque parabat: / conveniunt quibus aut odium crudele tyranni / aut metus acer erat; naves, quæ forte paratæ, / corripiunt onerantque auro; portantur avari / Pygmalionis opes pelago; dux fœmina facti".
"Hither, where now the walls and fortress high, / of Carthage, and her rising homes are found, / they came, and there full cheaply did they buy, / such space – called Byrsa from the deed – of ground / as one bull's-hide could compass and surround."
"Devenere locos ubi nunc ingentia cernis / mœnia surgentemque novæ Carthaginis arcem, / mercatique solum, facti de nomine Byrsam, / taurino quantum possent circumdare tergo".
"But who are ye, pray answer? on what quest / come ye? and whence and whither are ye bound?" / Her then AEneas, from his inmost breast / heaving a deep-drawn sigh, with labouring speech addressed: / "O Goddess, should I from the first unfold, / or could'st thou hear, the annals of our woe, / eve's star were shining, ere the tale were told."
"Sed vos qui tandem, quibus aut venistis ab oris, / quove tenetis iter?" Quærenti talibus ille / suspirans imoque trahens a pectore vocem: / "O dea, si prima repetens ab origine pergam / et vacet annales nostrorum audire laborum, / ante diem clauso componet Vesper Olympo".
"From ancient Troy – if thou the name dost know – / a chance-met storm hath driven us to and fro, / and tost us on the Libyan shores."
"Nos Troja antiqua, si vestras forte per aures / Trojæ nomen iit, diversa per æquora vectos / forte sua Libycis tempestas appulit oris".
"My name / is good AEneas; from the flames and foe / I bear Troy's rescued deities. My fame / outsoars the stars of heaven; a Jove-born race, we claim / a home in fair Italia far away."
"Sum pius Aeneas, raptos qui ex hoste Penates / classe veho mecum, fama super æthera notus; / Italiam quæro patriam et genus ab Jove summo".
"With twice ten ships I climbed the Phrygian main, / my goddess-mother pointing out the way, / as Fate commanded. Now scarce seven remain, / wave-worn and shattered by the tempest's strain."
"Bis denis Phrygium conscendi navibus æquor, / matre dea monstrante viam, data fata secutus; / vix septem convulsæ undis Euroque supersunt".
"Myself a stranger, friendless and unknown, / from Europe driven and Asia, roam in vain / the wilds of Libya."
"Ipse ignotus, egens, Libyæ deserta peragro, / Europa atque Asia pulsus".
Then his plaintive tone / no more could Venus bear, but interrupts her son: / "Stranger", she answered, "whosoe'er thou be; / not unbeloved of heavenly powers, I ween, / thou breath'st the vital air, whom Fate's decree / permits a Tyrian city to have seen."
Nec plura quærentem / passa Venus medio sic interfata dolore est: / "Quisquis es, haud, credo, invisus cœlestibus auras / vitales carpis, Tyriam qui adveneris urbem".
"But hence, and seek the palace of the queen. / Glad news I bear thee, of thy comrades brought, / the North-wind shifted and the skies serene; / thy ships have gained the harbour which they sought, / else vain my parents' lore the augury they taught."
"Perge modo, atque hinc te reginæ ad limina perfer, / namque tibi reduces socios classemque relatam / nuntio et in tutum versis Aquilonibus actam, / ni frustra augurium vani docuere parentes".
"See yon twelve swans, in jubilant array, / whom late Jove's eagle scattered through the sky; / now these alight, now those the pitch survey."
"Adspice bis senos lætantes agmine cycnos, / ætheria quos lapsa plaga Jovis ales aperto / turbabat cœlo; nunc terras ordine longo / aut capere aut captas jam despectare videntur".
"As they, returning, sport with joyous cry, / and flap their wings and circle in the sky, / e'en so thy vessels and each late-lost crew / safe now and scatheless in the harbour lie, / or, crowding canvas, hold the port in view."
"Ut reduces illi ludunt stridentibus alis, / et cœtu cinxere polum cantusque dedere; / haud aliter puppesque tuæ pubesque tuorum / aut portum tenent, aut pleno subit ostia velo".
"But hence, where leads the path, thy forward steps pursue."
"Perge modo et, qua te ducit via, dirige gressum".
So saying, she turned, and all refulgent showed / her roseate neck, and heavenly fragrance sweet / was breathed from her ambrosial hair. Down flowed / her loosened raiment, streaming to her feet, / and by her walk the Goddess shone complete.
Dixit et avertens rosea cervice refulsit, / ambrosiæque comæ divinum vertice odorem / spiravere; pedes vestis defluxit ad imos, / et vera incessu patuit dea.
"Ah, mother mine!" he chides her, as she flies, / "art thou, then, also cruel? Wherefore cheat / thy son so oft with images and lies? / Why may I not clasp hands, and talk without disguise?"
Ille ubi matrem / agnovit, tali fugientem est voce secutus: / "Quid natum toties, crudelis tu quoque, falsis / ludis imaginibus? Cur dextræ jungere dextram / non datur, ac veras audire et reddere voces?"
Thus he, reproaching. Towards the town they fare / in haste.
Talibus incusat gressumque ad mœnia tendit.
But Venus round them on the way / wrapt a thick mist, a mantle of dark air, / that none should see them, none should touch nor stay, / nor, urging idle questions, breed delay.
At Venus obscuro gradientes aëre sæpsit, / et multo nebulæ circum dea fudit amictu, / cernere ne quis eos neu quis contingere posset, / molirive moram aut veniendi poscere causas.
Then back, rejoicing, through the liquid air / to Paphos and her home she flies away, / where, steaming with Sabaean incense rare, / an hundred altars breathe with garlands fresh and fair.
Ipsa Paphum sublimis abit, sedesque revisit / læta suas, ubi templum illi, centumque Sabæo / ture calent aræ sertisque recentibus halant.
They by the path their forward steps pursued, / and climbed a hill, whose fronting summit frowned / steep o'er the town.
Corripuere viam interea, qua semita monstrat; / jamque ascendebant collem, qui plurimus urbi / imminet adversasque aspectat desuper arces.
Amazed, AEneas viewed / tall structures rise, where whilom huts were found, / the streets, the gates, the bustle and the sound.
Miratur molem Aeneas, magalia quondam, / miratur portas strepitumque et strata viarum.
Hotly the Tyrians are at work. These draw / the bastions' lines, roll stones and trench the ground; / or build the citadel.
Instant ardentes Tyrii: pars ducere muros / molirique arcem et manibus subvolvere saxa, / pars optare locum tecto et concludere sulco.
Those clothe with awe / the Senate; there they choose the judges for the law. / These delve the port; the broad foundations there / they lay for theatres of ample space, / and columns, hewn from marble rocks, prepare, / tall ornaments, the future stage to grace.
Jura magistratusque legunt sanctumque senatum. / Hic portus alii effodiunt; hic alta theatris / fundamenta locant alii, immanesque columnas / rupibus excidunt, scænis decora alta futuris.
As bees in early summer swarm apace / through flowery fields, when forth from dale and dell / they lead the full-grown offspring of the race, / or with the liquid honey store each cell, / and make the teeming hive with nectarous sweets to swell. / These ease the comers of their loads, those drive / the drones afar. The busy work each plies, / and sweet with thyme and honey smells the hive.
Qualis apes æstate nova per florea rura / exercet sub sole labor, cum gentis adultos / educunt fetus, aut cum liquentia mella / stipant et dulci distendunt nectare cellas, / aut onera accipiunt venientum, aut agmine facto / ignavum fucos pecus a præsepibus arcent: / fervet opus redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.
"O happy ye, whose walls already rise!" / Exclaimed AEneas, and with envious eyes / looked up where pinnacles and roof-tops showed / the new-born city; then in wondrous wise, / clothed in the covering of the friendly cloud, / passed through the midst unseen, and mingled with the crowd.
"O fortunati, quorum jam mœnia surgunt!" / Aeneas ait et fastigia suspicit urbis. / Infert se sæptus nebula (mirabile dictu) / per medios, miscetque viros neque cernitur ulli.
A grove stood in the city, rich in shade, / where storm-tost Tyrians, past the perilous brine, / dug from the ground, by royal Juno's aid, / a war-steed's head, to far-off days a sign / that wealth and prowess should adorn the line.
Lucus in urbe fuit media, lætissimus umbra, / quo primum jactati undis et turbine Pœni / effodere loco signum, quod regia Juno / monstrarat, caput acris equi: sic nam fore bello / egregiam et facilem victu per sæcula gentem.
Here, by the goddess and her gifts renowned, / Sidonian Dido built a stately shrine. / All brazen rose the threshold; brass was round / the door-posts; brazen doors on grating hinges sound.
Hic templum Junoni ingens Sidonia Dido / condebat, donis opulentum et numine divæ, / ærea cui gradibus surgebant limina nexæque / ære trabes, foribus cardo stridebat ahenis.
You never liked them.
Numquam eos amabas.
Do you have a big family?
Magnane est familia tua?
Here a new sight AEneas' hopes upraised, / and fear was softened, and his heart was mann'd.
Hoc primum in luco nova res oblata timorem / leniit, hic primum Aeneas sperare salutem / ausus, et afflictis melius confidere rebus.
For while, the queen awaiting, round he gazed, / and marvelled at he happy town, and scanned / the rival labours of each craftman's hand, / behold, Troy's battles on the walls appear, / the war, since noised through many a distant land, / there Priam and th' Atridae twain, and here / Achilles, fierce to both, still ruthless and severe.
Namque sub ingenti lustrat dum singula templo, / reginam opperiens, dum quæ fortuna sit urbi / artificumque manus inter se operumque laborem / miratur, videt Iliacas ex ordine pugnas / bellaque jam fama totum vulgata per orbem, / Atridas Priamumque et sævum ambobus Achillem.
Pensive he stood, and with a rising tear, / "What lands, Achates, on the earth, but know / our labours?"
Constitit et lacrimans: "Quis jam locus", inquit, "Achate, / quæ regio in terris nostri non plena laboris?"
"See our Priam! Even here / worth wins her due, and there are tears to flow, / and human hearts to feel for human woe."
"En Priamus! Sunt hic etiam sua præmia laudi; / sunt lacrimæ rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt".
"Fear not," he cries, "Troy's glory yet shall gain / some safety."
"Solve metus; feret hæc aliquam tibi fama salutem".
Thus upon the empty show / he feeds his soul, while ever and again / deeply he sighs, and tears run down his cheeks like rain.
Sic ait atque animum pictura pascit inani, / multa gemens, largoque humectat flumine vultum.
He sees, how, fighting round the Trojan wall, / here fled the Greeks, the Trojan youth pursue, / here fled the Phrygians, and, with helmet tall, / Achilles in his chariot stormed and slew.
Namque videbat uti bellantes Pergama circum / hac fugerent Graji, premeret Trojana juventus; / hac Phryges, instaret curru cristatus Achilles.
Not far, with tears, the snowy tents he knew / of Rhesus, where Tydides, bathed in blood, / broke in at midnight with his murderous crew, / and drove the hot steeds campward, ere the food / of Trojan plains they browsed, or drank the Xanthian flood.
Nec procul hinc Rhesi niveis tentoria velis / agnoscit lacrimans, primo quæ prodita somno / Tydides multa vastabat cæde cruentus, / ardentesque avertit equos in castra, priusquam / pabula gustassent Trojæ Xanthumque bibissent.
There, reft of arms, poor Troilus, rash to dare / Achilles, by his horses dragged amain, / hangs from his empty chariot. Neck and hair / trail on the ground; his hand still grasps the rein; / the spear inverted scores the dusty plain.
Parte alia fugiens amissis Troilus armis, / infelix puer atque impar congressus Achilli, / fertur equis curruque hæret resupinus inani, / lora tenens tamen; huic cervixque comæque trahuntur / per terram, et versa pulvis inscribitur hasta.
Meanwhile, with beaten breasts and streaming hair, / the Trojan dames, a sad and suppliant train, / the veil to partial Pallas' temple bear. / Stern, with averted eyes the Goddess spurns their prayer.
Interea ad templum non aequae Palladis ibant / crinibus Iliades passis, peplumque ferebant, / suppliciter tristes et tunsae pectora palmis; / diva solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat.
Thrice had Achilles round the Trojan wall / dragged Hector; there the slayer sells the slain.
Ter circum Iliacos raptaverat Hectora muros / exanimumque auro corpus vendebat Achilles.
Sighing he sees him, chariot, arms and all, / and Priam, spreading helpless hands in vain.
Tum vero ingentem gemitum dat pectore ab imo, / ut spolia, ut currus, utque ipsum corpus amici, / tendentemque manus Priamum conspexit inermes.
Himself he knows among the Greeks again, / black Memnon's arms, and all his Eastern clan.
Se quoque principibus permixtum agnovit Achivis, / Eoasque acies et nigri Memnonis arma.
Penthesilea's Amazonian train / with moony shields. Bare-breasted, in the van, / girt with a golden zone, the maiden fights with man.
Ducit Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis / Penthesilea furens, mediisque in millibus ardet, / aurea subnectens exsertae cingula mammae, / bellatrix, audetque viris concurrere virgo.
Thus while AEneas, with set gaze and long, / hangs, mute with wonder, on the wildering scene, / lo! to the temple, with a numerous throng / of youthful followers, moves the beauteous Queen.
Haec dum Dardanio Aeneae miranda videntur, / dum stupet obtutuque haeret defixus in uno, / regina ad templum, forma pulcherrima Dido, / incessit, magna juvenum stipante caterva.
Such as Diana, with her Oreads seen / on swift Eurotas' banks or Cynthus' crest, / leading the dances. She, in form and mien, / armed with her quiver, towers above the rest, / and tranquil pleasure thrills Latona's silent breast.
Qualis in Eurotae ripis aut per juga Cynthi / exercet Diana choros, quam mille secutae / hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades. Illa pharetram / fert humero, gradiensque deas supereminet omnes: / Latonae tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus.
E'en such was Dido; so with joyous mien, / urging the business of her rising state, / among the concourse passed the Tyrian queen.
Talis erat Dido, talem se laeta ferebat / per medios, instans operi regnisque futuris.
Then, girt with guards, within the temple's gate / beneath the centre of the dome she sate.
Tum foribus divae, media testudine templi, / septa armis, solioque alte subnixa, resedit.
There, ministering justice, she presides, / and deals the law, and from her throne of state, / as choice determines or as chance decides, / to each, in equal share, his separate task divides. / Sudden, behold a concourse. Looking down, / his late-lost friends AEneas sees again, / Segestus, brave Cloanthus of renown, / Antheus and others of the Trojan train, / whom the black squall had scattered o'er the main, / and driven afar upon an alien strand.
Jura dabat legesque viris, operumque laborem / partibus aequabat justis, aut sorte trahebat: / cum subito Aeneas concursu accedere magno / Anthea Sergestumque videt fortemque Cloanthum / Teucrorumque alios, ater quos aequore turbo / dispulerat penitusque alias avexerat oras.
At once, 'twixt joy and terror rent in twain, / amazed, AEneas and Achates stand, / and long to greet old friends and clasp a comrade's hand. / Yet wildering wonder at so strange a scene / still holds them mute, while anxious thoughts divide / their doubtful minds.
Obstipuit simul ipse simul percussus Achates / laetitiaque metuque; avidi conjungere dextras / ardebant, sed res animos incognita turbat.
And in the cloud unseen, / wrapt in its hollow covering, they abide / and note what fortune did their friends betide, / and whence they come, and why for grace they sue, / and on what shore they left the fleet to bide, / for chosen captains came from every crew, / and towards the sacred fane with clamorous cries they drew.
Dissimulant et nube cava speculantur amicti, / quae fortuna viris, classem quo litore linquant, / quid veniant; cunctis nam lecti navibus ibant, / orantes veniam et templum clamore petebant.
Then, audience granted, as the fane they filled, / thus calmly spake the eldest of the train, / Ilioneus: "O queen, whom Jove hath willed / to found this new-born city, here to reign, / and stubborn tribes with justice to refrain, / we, Troy's poor fugitives, implore thy grace, / storm-tost and wandering over every main: / forbid the flames our vessels to deface, / mark our afflicted plight, and spare a pious race."
Postquam introgressi et coram data copia fandi, / maximus Ilioneus placido sic pectore coepit: / "O regina, novam cui condere Jupiter urbem / justitiaque dedit gentes frenare superbas, / Troes te miseri, ventis maria omnia vecti, / oramus: prohibe infandos a navibus ignes, / parce pio generi et propius res adspice nostras!"
"We come not hither with the sword to rend / your Libyan homes, and shoreward drive the prey. / Nay, no such violence our thoughts intend, / such pride suits not the vanquished."
"Non nos aut ferro Lybicos populare Penates / venimus, aut raptas ad litora vertere praedas: / non ea vis animo, nec tanta superbia victis".
"Far away / there lies a place (Greeks style the land to-day / Hesperia) fruitful and of ancient fame / and strong in arms. OEnotrian folk, they say, / first tilled the soil. Italian is the name / borne by the later race, with Italus who came."
"Est locus, Hesperiam Graii cognomine dicunt, / terra antiqua, potens armis atque ubere glebae; / Oenotri coluere viri; nunc fama minores / Italiam dixisse ducis de nomine gentem".
"Thither we sailed, when, rising with the wave, / Orion dashed us on the shoals, the prey / of wanton winds, and mastering billows drave / our vessels on the pathless rocks astray. / We few have floated to your shore."
"Hic cursus fuit; / cum subito assurgens fluctu nimbosus Orion / in vada caeca tulit, penitusque procacibus Austris / perque undas, superante salo, perque invia saxa / dispulit; huc pauci vestris adnavimus oris".
"O say, / what manner of mankind is here? What land / is this, to treat us in this barbarous way? / They grudge the very shelter of the sand, / and call to arms and bar our footsteps from the strand!"
"Quod genus hoc hominum? quaeve hunc tam barbara morem / permittit patria? Hospitio prohibemur arenae; / bella cient, primaque vetant consistere terra!"
Tom protected his wife.
Thomas suam uxorem servavit.
"What did you say?" "Nothing to you."
"Quid dixisti?" "Tibi dixi nihil."
Tom did it for you.
Thomas pro vobis hoc fecit.
Tom did it for you.
Thomas pro te hoc fecit.
Don't talk to me like that.
Ne mecum sic loquaris.
Tom and Mary live close to the ocean.
Thomas Mariaque prope oceanum habitant.
When I was happy, I had many friends. When times were gray, I found myself alone.
donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos, tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris
"If human kind and mortal arms ye scorn, / think of the Gods, who judge the wrong and right."
"Si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma, / at sperate deos memores fandi atque nefandi".
"A king was ours, AEneas; ne'er was born / a man more just, more valiant in the fight, / more famed for piety and deeds of might."
"Rex erat Aeneas nobis, quo justior alter / nec pietate fuit nec bello major et armis".
"If yet he lives and looks upon the sun, / nor cruel death hath snatched him from the light, / no fear have we, nor need hast thou to shun / a Trojan guest, or rue kin offices begun."
"Quem si fata virum servant, si vescitur aura / aetheria neque adhuc crudelibus occubat umbris, / non metus, officio nec te certasse priorem / poeniteat".
"Towns yet for us in Sicily remain, / and arms, and, sprung from Trojan sires of yore, / our kinsman there, Acestes, holds his reign."
"Sunt et Siculis regionibus urbes / arvaque, Trojanoque a sanguine clarus Acestes".
"Grant us to draw our scattered fleet ashore, / and fit new planks and branches for the oar. / So, if with king and comrades brought again, / the Fates allow us to reach Italia's shore, / Italia gladly and the Latian plain / seek we."
"Quassatam ventis liceat subducere classem / et silvis aptare trabes et stringere remos: / si datur Italiam, sociis et rege recepto, / tendere, ut Italiam laeti Latiumque petamos".
I give the book to my friend.
Do librum amico.
"But else, if thoughts of safety be in vain, / if thee, dear Sire, the Libyan deep doth hide, / nor hopes of young Iulus more can cheer, / back let our barks to the Sicanian tide / and proffered homes and king Acestes steer."
"Sin absumpta salus, et te, pater optime Teucrum, / pontus habet Libyae, nec spes jam restat Iuli, / at freta Sicaniae saltem sedesque paratas, / unde huc advecti, regemque petamus Acesten".
He spake; the Dardans answered with a cheer.
Talibus Ilioneus; cuncti simul ore fremebant / Dardanidae.
Then Dido thus, with downcast look sedate: / "Take courage, Trojans, and dismiss your fear. / My kingdom's newness and the stress of Fate / force me to guard far off the frontiers of my state."
Tum breviter Dido, vultum demissa, profatur: / "Solvite corde metum, Teucri, secludite curas. / Res dura et regni novitas me talia cogunt / moliri, et late fines custode tueri".
"Who knows not Troy, th' AEneian house of fame, / the deeds and doers, and the war's renown / that fired the world? Not hearts so dull and tame / have Punic folk; not so is Phoebus known / to turn his back upon our Tyrian town."
"Quis genus Aeneadum, quis Trojae nesciat urbem / virtutesque virosque aut tanti incendia belli? / Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora Poeni, / nec tam aversus equos Tyria Sol jungit ab urbe".
"Whether ye sail to great Hesperia's shore /and Saturn's fields, or seek the realms that own / Acestes' sway, where Eryx reigned of yore, / safe will I send you hence, and speed you with my store."
"Seu vos Hesperiam magnam Saturniaque arva, / sive Erycis fines regemque optatis Acesten, / auxilio tutos dimittam opibusque juvabo".
"Else, would ye settle in this realm, the town / I build is yours; draw up your ships to land. / Trojan and Tyrian will I treat as one."
"Vultis et his mecum pariter considere regnis? / Urbem quam statuo, vestra est, subducite naves; / Tros Tyriusque mihi nullo discrimine agetur".
"Would that your king AEneas here could stand, / driven by the gale that drove you to this strand! / Natheless, to scour the country, will I send / some trusty messengers, with strict command / to search through Libya to the furthest end, / lest, cast ashore, through town or lonely wood he wend."
"Atque utinam rex ipse Noto compulsus eodem / afforet Aeneas! Equidem per litora certos / dimittam et Libyae lustrare extrema jubebo, / si quibus ejectus silvis aut urbibus errat".
Roused by these words, long since the sire of Troy / yearned, like his friend, their comrades to surprise / and burst the cloud.
His animum arrecti dictis, et fortis Achates / et pater Aeneas jamdudum erumpere nubem / ardebant.
Then first with eager joy / "O Goddess-born," the bold Achates cries, / "how now? What purpose doth thy mind devise? / Lo! all are safe – ships, comrades brought again; / one only fails us, who before our eyes / sank in the midst of the engulfing main. / All else confirms the tale thy mother told thee plain."
Prior Aenean compellat Achates: / "Nate dea, quae nunc animo sententia surgit? / Omnia tuta vides, classem sociosque receptos; / unus abest, medio in fluctu quem vidimus ipsi / submersum; dictis respondent cetera matris".
Scarce had he said, when straight the ambient cloud / broke open, melting into day's clear light.
Vix ea fatus erat, cum circumfusa repente / scindit se nubes et in aethera purgat apertum.
And bathed in sunshine stood the chief, endowed / with shape and features most divinely bright. / For graceful tresses and the purple light / of youth did Venus in her child unfold, / and sprightly lustre breathed upon his sight, / beauteous as ivory, or when artists mould / silver or Parian stone, enchased in yellow gold.
Restitit Aeneas claraque in luce refulsit, / os humerosque deo similis; namque ipsa decoram / caesariem nato genetrix lumenque juventae / purpureum et laetos oculis afflarat honores, / quale manus addunt ebori decus, aut ubi flavo / argentum Pariusve lapis circumdatur auro.
Then to the queen, all wondering, he exclaimed, / "Behold me, Troy's AEneas; I am here, / the man ye seek, from Libyan waves reclaimed."
Tum sic reginam alloquitur, cunctisque repente / improvisus ait: "Coram, quem quaeritis, adsum, / Troius Aeneas, Libycis ereptus ab undis".
"Thou, who alone Troy's sorrows deign'st to hear, / and us, the gleanings of the Danaan spear, / poor world-wide wanderers and in desperate case, / has ta'en to share thy city and thy cheer, / meet thanks nor we, nor what of Dardan race / yet roams the earth, can give to recompense thy grace."
"O sola infandos Trojae miserata labores, / quae nos, reliquias Danaum, terraeque marisque / omnibus exhaustos jam casibus, omnium egenos, / urbem domo, socias, grates persolvere dignas / non opis est nostrae, Dido, nec quidquid ubique est / gentis Dardaniae, magnum quae sparsa per orbem".
"The gods, if gods the good and just regard, / and thy own conscience, that approves the right, / grant thee due guerdon and a fit reward."
"Di tibi, si qua pios respectant numina, si quid / usquam justitia est et mens sibi conscia recti, / praemia digna ferant".
"What happy ages did thy birth delight? / What godlike parents bore a child so bright?"
"Quae te tam laeta tulerunt / saecula? Qui tanti talem genuere parentes?"
I can't recall her name at the moment.
Hoc momento nominis eius non memini.
"While running rivers hasten to the main, / while yon pure ether feeds the stars with light, / while shadows round the hill-slopes wax and wane, / thy fame, wher'er I go, thy praises shall remain."
"In freta dum fluvii current, dum montibus umbrae / lustrabunt convexa, polus dum sidera pascet, / semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt, / quae me cumque vocant terrae".
So saying AEneas with his left hand pressed / Serestus, and Ilioneus with his right, / Brave Gyas, brave Cloanthus and the rest.
Sic fatus, amicum / Ilionea petit dextra, laevaque Serestum, / post alios, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum.
Then Dido, struck with wonder at the sight / of one so great and in so strange a plight, / "O Goddess-born! what fate through dangers sore, / what force to savage coasts compels thy flight?"
Obstupuit primo adspectu Sidonia Dido, / casu deinde viri tanto, et sic ore locuta est: / "Quis te, nate dea, per tanta pericula casus / insequitur? Quae vis immanibus applicat oris?"
"Art thou, then, that AEneas, whom of yore / Venus on Simois' banks to old Anchises bore?"
"Tune ille Aeneas quem Dardanio Anchisae / alma Venus Phrygii genuit Simoentis ad undam?"
"Ay, well I mind me how in days of yore / to Sidon exiled Teucer crossed the main, / to seek new kingdoms and the aid implore / of Belus. He, my father Belus, then / ruled Cyprus, victor of the wasted plain."
"Atque equidem Teucrum memini Sidona venire / finibus expulsum patriis, nova regna petentem / auxilio Beli; genitor tum Belus opimam / vastabat Cyprum, et victor dicione tenebat".
"Since then thy name and Ilion's fate are known, / and all the princes of Pelasgia's reign."
"Tempore jam ex illo casus mihi cognitus urbis / Trojanae nomenque tuum regesque Pelasgi".
"Himself, a foe, oft lauded Troy's renown, / and claimed the Teucrian sires as kinsmen of his own."
"Ipse hostis Teucros insigni laude ferebat, / seque ortum antiqua Teucrorum ab stirpe volebat".
"Welcome, then, heroes!"
"Quare agite, o tectis, juvenes, succedite nostris".
"Me hath Fortune willed / long tost, like you, through sufferings, here to rest / and find at length a refuge. Not unskilled / in woe, I learn to succour the distrest."
"Me quoque per multos similis fortuna labores / jactatam hac demum voluit consistere terra. / Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco".
So to the palace she escorts her guest, / and calls for festal honours in the shrine.
Sic memorat; simul Aenean in regia ducit / tecta, simul divum templis indicit honorem.
Then shoreward sends beeves twenty to the rest, / a hundred boars, of broad and bristly chine, / a hundred lambs and ews and gladdening gifts of wine.
Nec minus interea sociis ad litora mittit / viginti tauros, magnorum horrentia centum / terga suum, pingues centum cum matribus agnos, / munera lætitiamque dii.
Meanwhile with regal splendour they arrayed / the palace-hall, where feast and banquet high / all in the centre of the space is laid.
At domus interior regali splendida luxu / instruitur, mediisque parant convivia tectis.
And forth they bring the broidered tapestry, / with purple dyed and wrought full cunningly. / The tables groan with silver; there are told / the deeds of prowess for the gazer's eye, / a long, long series, of their sires of old, / traced from the nation's birth, and graven in the gold.
Arte laboratæ vestes ostroque superbo, / ingens argentum mensis, cælataque in auro / fortia facta patrum, series longissima rerum / per tot ducta viros antiqua ab origine gentis.
But good AEneas (for a father's care / no rest allows him) to the ships sends down / Achates, to Ascanius charged to bear / the welcome news, and bring him to the town. / The father's fondness centres on the son.
Aeneas (neque enim patrius consistere mentem / passus amor) rapidum ad naves præmittit Achaten, / Ascanio ferat hæc, ipsumque ad mœnia ducat: / omnis in Ascanio cari stat cura parentis.
Rich presents, too, he sends for, saved of old / from Troy, a veil, whose saffron edges shone / fringed with acanthus, glorious to behold, / a broidered mantle, stiff with figures wrought in gold. / Fair Helen's ornaments, from Argos brought, / the gift of Leda, when the Trojan shore / and lawless nuptials o'er the waves she sought.
Munera præterea Iliacis erepta ruinis / ferre jubet, pallam signis auroque rigentem, / et circumtextum croceo velamen acantho, / ornatus Argivæ Helenæ, quos illa Mycenis, / Pergama cum peteret inconcessosque Hymenæos, / extulerat, matris Ledæ mirabile donum.
Therewith the royal sceptre, which of yore / Ilione, Priam's eldest daughter, bore; / her shining necklace, strung with costly beads, / and diadem, rimmed with gold and studded o'er / with sparkling gems. Thus charged, Achates heeds, / and towards the ships forthwith in eager haste proceeds.
Præterea sceptrum, Ilione quod gesserat olim, / maxima natarum Priami, colloque monile / baccatum, et duplicem gemmis auroque coronam. / Hæc celerans, iter ad naves tendebat Achates.
But crafty Cytherea planned meanwhile / new arts, new schemes: that Cupid should conspire, / in likeness of Ascanius, to beguile / the queen with gifts, and kindle fierce desire, / and turn the marrow of her bones to fire.
At Cytherea novas artes, nova pectore versat / consilia, ut faciem mutatus et ora Cupido / pro dulci Ascanio veniat, donisque furentem / incendat reginam atque ossibus impicet ignem.
Fierce Juno's hatred rankles in her breast; / the two-faced house, the double tongues of Tyre / she fears, and with the night returns unrest.
Quippe domum timet ambiguam Tyriosque bilingues; / urit atrox Juno, et sub noctem cura recursat.
So now to winged Love this mandate she addressed: / "O son, sole source of all my strength and power, / who durst high Jove's Typhoean bolts disdain, / to thee I fly, thy deity implore."
Ergo his aligerum dictis affatur Amorem: / "Nate, meæ vires, mea magna potentia, solus, / nate, patris summi qui tela Typhoëa temnis, / ad te confugio et supplex tua numina posco".
"Thou know'st, who oft hast sorrowed with my pain, / how, tost by Juno's rancour, o'er the main / thy brother wanders."
"Frater ut Aeneas pelago tuus omnia circum / litora jactetur odiis Junonis iniquæ, / nota tibi, et nostro doluisti sæpe dolore".
"Him with speeches fair / and sweet allurements doth the queen detain; / but Juno's hospitality I fear; / scarce at an hour like this will she her hand forbear."
"Nunc Phœnissa tenet Dido blandisque moratur / vocibus, et vereor, quo se Junonia vertant / hospitia: haud tanto cessabit cardine rerum".
"Soft snares I purpose round the queen to weave, / and wrap her soul in flames, that power malign / shall never change her, but her heart shall cleave / fast to AEneas with a love like mine."
"Quocirca capere ante dolis et cingere flamma / reginam meditor, ne quo se numine mutet, / sed magno Aeneæ mecum teneatur amore".
"Now learn, how best to compass my design. / To Tyrian Carthage hastes the princely boy, / prompt at the summons of his sire divine, / my prime solicitude, my chiefest joy, / fraught with brave store of gifts, saved from the flames of Troy."
"Qua facere id possis, nostram nunc accipe mentem: / Regius accitu cari genitoris ad urbem / Sidoniam puer ire parat, mea maxima cura, / dona ferens pelago et flammis restantia Trojæ".
"Him on Idalia, lulled into a dream, / will I secrete, or on the sacred height / of lone Cythera, lest he learn the scheme, / or by his sudden presence mar the sleight."
"Hunc ego sopitum somno super alta Cythera / aut super Idalium sacrata sede recondam, / ne qua scire dolos mediusve occurrere possit".
"Take thou his likeness, only for a night, / and wear the boyish features that are thine; / and when the queen, in rapture of delight, / amid the royal banquet and the wine, / shall lock thee in her arms, and press her lips to thine, / then steal into her bosom, and inspire / through all her veins with unsuspected sleight / the poisoned sting of passion and desire."
"Tu faciem illius noctem non amplius unam / falle dolo, et notos pueri puer indue vultus, / ut, cum te gremio accipiet lætissima Dido / regales inter mensas laticemque Lyæum, / cum dabit amplexus atque oscula dulcia figet, / occultum inspires ignem fallasque veneno".
Young Love obeys, and doffs his plumage light, / and, like Iulus, trips forth with delight.
Paret Amor dictis caræ genetricis, et alas / exuit et gressu gaudens incedit Iuli.
She o'er Ascanius rains a soft repose, / and gently bears him to Idalia's height, / where breathing marjoram around him throws / sweet shade, and odorous flowers his slumbering limbs compose.
At Venus Ascanio placidam per membra quietem / irrigat, et fotum gremio dea tollit in altos / Idaliæ lucos, ubi mollis amaracus illum / floribus et dulci adspirans complectitur umbra.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Thomas in Australia nunc habitat.
I must get back to work.
Ad opus redire debeo.
Forth Cupid, at his mother's word, repairs, / and merrily, for brave Achates led, / the royal presents to the Tyrians bears.
Jamque ibat, dicto parens, et dona Cupido / regia portabat Tyriis, duce laetus Achate.
There, under gorgeous curtains, at the head / sate Dido, throned upon a golden bed.
Cum venit, aulæis jam se regina superbis / aurea composuit sponda mediamque locavit.
There, flocking in, the Trojans and their King / recline on purple coverlets outspread.
Jam pater Aeneas et jam Trojana juventus / conveniunt, stratoque super discumbitur ostro.
Bread, heaped is baskets, the attendants bring, / towels with smooth-shorn nap, and water from the spring.
Dant manibus famuli lymphas, Cereremque canistris / expediunt, tonsisque ferunt mantelia villis.
Within are fifty maidens, charged with care / to dress the food, and nurse the flames divine. / A hundred more, and youths like-aged, prepare / to load the tables and arrange the wine.
Quinquaginta intus famulæ, quibus ordine longo / cura penum struere et flammis adolere Penates; / centum aliæ totidemque pares ætate ministri, / qui dapibus mensas onerent et pocula ponant.
There, entering too, on broidered seats recline / the Tyrians, crowding through the festive court.
Nec non et Tyrii per limina læta frequentes / convenere, toris jussi discumbere pictis.
They praise the boy, his glowing looks divine, / the words he feigned, the royal gifts he brought, / the robe, the saffron veil with bright acanthus wrought.
Mirantur dona Aeneæ, mirantur Iulum, / flagrantesque dei vultus simulataque verba / pallamque et pictum croceo velamen acantho.
Doomed to devouring love, the hapless queen / burns as she gazes, with insatiate fire, / charmed by his presents and his youthful mien.
Præcipue infelix, pesti devota futuræ, / expleri mentem nequit ardescitque tuendo / Phoenissa, et pariter puero donisque movetur.
He, fondly clinging to his fancied sire, / gave all the love that parents' hearts desire, / then seeks the queen.
Ille ubi complexu Aeneæ colloque pependit, / et magnum falsi implevit genitoris amorem, / reginam petit.
She, fixing on the boy / her eyes, her soul, impatient to admire, / now, fondling, folds him to her lap with joy; / weetless, alas! what god is plotting to destroy.
Hæc oculis, hæc pectore toto / hæret et interdum gremio fovet, inscia Dido, / insideat quantus miseræ deus.
True to his Paphian mother, trace by trace, / slowly the Love-god with prevenient art, / begins the lost Sychaeus to efface, / and living passion to a breast impart / long dead to feeling, and a vacant heart.
At memor ille / matris Acidaliæ, paulatim abolere Sychæum / incipit, et vivo tentat prævertere amore / jam pridem resides animos desuetaque corda.
Now, hushed the banquet and the tables all / removed, huge wine-bowls for each guest apart / they wreathe with flowers.
Postquam prima quies epulis mensæque remotae, / crateras magnos statuunt et vina coronant.
The noise of festival / rings through the spacious courts, and rolls along the hall. / There, blazing from the gilded roof, are seen / bright lamps, and torches turn the night to day.
Fit strepitus tectis, vocemque per ampla volutant / atria; dependent lychni laquearibus aureis / incensi, et noctem flammis funalia vincunt.
Now for the ponderous goblet called the Queen, / of jewelled gold, which Belus used and they / of Belus' line, and poured the wine straightway.
Hic regina gravem gemmis auroque poposcit / implevitque mero pateram, quam Belus et omnes / a Belo soliti.
And prayed, while silence filled the crowded hall: / "Great Jove, the host's lawgiver, bless this day / to these my Tyrians and the Trojans all. / Long may our children's sons this solemn feast recall."
Tum facta silentia tectis: / "Jupiter (hospitibus nam te dare jura loquuntur), / hunc lætum Tyriisque diem Trojaque profectis / esse velis, nostrosque hujus meminisse minores!"
"Come, jolly Bacchus, giver of delight; / kind Juno, come; and ye with fair accord / and friendly spirit hold the feast aright."
"Adsit lætitæ Bacchus dator, et bona Juno! / Et vos, o, cœtum, Tyrii, celebrate faventes!"
So spake the Queen, and on the festal board / the prime libation to the gods outpoured, / then lightly to her lips the goblet pressed, / and gave to Bitias. Challenged by the word, / he dived into the brimming gold with zest, / and quaffed the foaming bowl, and after him, the rest.
Dixit et in mensam laticum libavit honorem, / primaque, libato, summo tenus attigit ore, / tum Bitiae dedit increpitans; ille impiger hausit / spumantem pateram, et pleno se proluit auro; / post alii proceres.
His golden lyre long-haired Iopas tunes, / and sings what Atlas taught in loftiest strain.
Cithara crinitus Iopas / personat aurata, docuit quem maximus Atlas.
The sun's eclipses and the changing moons, / whence man and beast, whence lightning and the rain, / Arcturus, watery Hyads and the Wain; / what causes make the winter nights so long, / why sinks the sun so quickly in the main.
Hic canit errantem lunam solisque labores, / unde hominum genus et pecudes, unde imber et ignes; / Arcturum pluviasque Hyadas geminosque Triones; / quid tantum oceano properent se tingerent soles / hiberni, vel quæ tardis mora noctibus obstet.
All this he sings, and ravished at the song, / Tyrians and Trojan guests the loud applause prolong.
Ingeminant plausu Tyrii, Troesque sequuntur.
With various talks the night poor Dido wore, / and drank deep love, and nursed her inward flame, / of Priam much she asks, of Hector more, / now in what arms Aurora's offspring came, / of Diomede's horses and Achilles' fame.
Nec non et vario noctem sermone trahebat / infelix Dido, longumque bibebat amorem, / multa super Priamo rogitans, super Hectore multa; / nunc, quibus Auroræ venisset filius armis, / nunc, quales Diomedis equi, nunc, quantus Achilles.
"Tell me," she says, "thy wanderings; stranger, come, / thy friends' mishaps and Danaan wiles proclaim; / for seven long summers now have seen thee roam / o'er every land and sea, far from thy native home."
"Imo age et a prima dic, hospes, origine nobis / insidias, inquit, Danaum, casusque tuorum / erroresque tuos; nam te jam septima portat / omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus æstas".

All hushed intent, when from his lofty seat / Troy's sire began:
Conticuere omnes, intentique ora tenebant. / Inde toro pater Aeneas sic orsus ab alto:
"O queen, a tale too true, / too sad for words, thou biddest me repeat; / how Ilion perished, and the Danaan crew / her power and all her wailful realm o'erthrew: / the woes I saw, thrice piteous to behold, / and largely shared."
"Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem, / Trojanas ut opes et lamentabile regnum / eruerint Danai / quæque ipse miserrima vidi, / et quorum pars magna fui."
"What Myrmidon, or who / of stern Ulysses' warriors can withhold / his tears, to tell such things, as thou would'st have re-told?"
"Quis talia fando / Myrmidonum Dolopumve aut duri miles Ulixi / temperet a lacrimis?"
"And now already from the heaven's high steep / the dewy night wheels down, and sinking slow, / the stars are gently wooing us to sleep. / But, if thy longing be so great to know / the tale of Troy's last agony and woe, / the toils we suffered, though my heart doth ache, / and grief would fain the memory forego / of scenes so sad, yet, Lady, for thy sake / I will begin," and thus the sire of Troy outspake:
"Et jam nox humida cœlo / præcipitat suadentque cadentia sidera somnos. / Sed si tantus amor casus cognoscere nostros / et breviter Trojæ supremum audire laborem, / quamquam animus meminisse horret luctuque refugit, / incipiam."
"Broken by war, long baffled by the force / of fate, as fortune and their hopes decline, / the Danaan leaders build a monstrous horse, / huge as a hill, by Pallas' craft divine, / and cleft fir-timbers in the ribs entwine. / They feign it vowed for their return, so goes / the tale."
"Fracti bello fatisque repulsi / ductores Danaum, tot jam labentibus annis, / instar montis equum divina Palladis arte / ædificant sectaque intexunt abiete costas: / votum pro reditu simulant; ea fama vagatur."
"And deep within the sides of pine / and caverns of the womb by stealth enclose / armed men, a chosen band, drawn as the lots dispose."
"Huc delecta virum sortiti corpora furtim / includunt cæco lateri, penitusque cavernas / ingentes uterumque armato milite complent."
"In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle / renowned and rich, while Priam held command, / now a mere bay and roadstead fraught with guile. / Thus far they sailed, and on the lonely strand / lay hid,"
"Est in conspectu Tenedos, notissima fama / insula, dives opum, Priami dum regna manebant, / nunc tantum sinus et statio male fida carinis: / huc se provecti deserto in litore condunt."
"... while fondly to Mycenae's land / we thought the winds had borne them."
"Nos abiisse rati et vento petiisse Mycenas."
"Troy once more / shakes off her ten years' sorrow. Open stand / the gates. With joy to the abandoned shore, / the places bare of foes, the Dorian lines we pour."
"Ergo omnis longo solvit se Teucria luctu; / panduntur portæ: juvat ire et Dorica castra / desertosque videre locos litusque relictum."
"Here camped the brave Dolopians, there was set / the tent of fierce Achilles; yonder lay / the fleet, and here the rival armies met / and mingled."
"Hic Dolopum manus, hic sævus tendebat Achilles; / classibus hic locus, hic acie certare solebant."
"Some with wonder and dismay / the maid Minerva's fatal gift survey."
"Pars stupet innuptæ donum exitiale Minervæ, / et molem mirantur equi."
"Then first Thymaetes cries aloud, to go / and through the gates the monstrous horse convey / and lodge it in the citadel. E'en so / his fraud or Troy's dark fates were working for our woe."
"Primusque Thymœtes / duci intra muros hortatur et arce locari, / sive dolo, seu jam Trojæ sic fata ferebant."
"But Capys and the rest, of sounder mind, / urge us to tumble in the rolling tide / the doubtful gift, for treachery designed, / or burn with fire, or pierce the hollow side, / and probe the caverns where the Danaans hide."
"At Capys, et quorum melior sententia menti, / aut pelago Danaum insidias suspectaque dona / præcipitare jubent subjectisque urere flammis, / aut terebrare cavas uteri et temptare latebras."
"Thus while they waver and, perplex with doubt, / urge diverse counsels, and in parts divide, / lo, from the citadel, foremost of a rout, / breathless Laocoon runs, and from afar cries out: / 'Ah! wretched townsmen! do ye think the foe / gone, or that guileless are their gifts? O blind / with madness! Thus Ulysses do ye know?'"
"Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus. / Primus ibi ante omnes, magna comitante caterva, / Laocoon ardens summa decurrit ab arce, / et procul: 'O miseri, quæ tanta insania, cives? / Creditis avectos hostes, aut ulla putatis / dona carere dolis Danaum? Sic notus Ulixes?'"
'Or Grecians in these timbers lurk confined, / or 'tis some engine of assault, designed / to breach the walls, and lay our houses bare, / and storm the town. Some mischief lies behind. / Trust not the horse, ye Teucrians. Whatso'er / this means, I fear the Greeks, for all the gifts they bear.'
"Aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achivi, / aut hæc in nostros fabricata est machina muros, / inspectura domos venturaque desuper urbi, / aut aliquis latet error. Equo ne credite, Teucri. / Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentes."
"So saying, his mighty spear, with all his force, / full at the flank against the ribs he drave, / and pierced the bellying framework of the horse. / Quivering, it stood; the hollow chambers gave / a groan, that echoed from the womb's dark cave."
"Sic fatus, validis ingentem viribus hastam / in latus inque feri curvam compagibus alvum / contorsit. Stetit illa tremens, uteroque recusso / insonuere cavæ gemitumque dedere cavernæ."
"Then, but for folly or Fate's adverse power, / his word had made us with our trusty glaive / lay bare the Argive ambush, and this hour / should Ilion stand, and thou, O Priam's lofty tower!"
"Et, si fata deum, si mens non læva fuisset, / impulerat ferro Argolicas fœdare latebras, / Trojaque nunc stares Priamique arx alta maneres!"
"Lo, now to Priam, with exulting cries, / the Dardan shepherds drag a youth unknown, / with hands fast pinioned, and in captive guise. / Caught on the way, by cunning of his own, / this end to compass, and betray the town. / Prepared for either venture, void or fear, / the crafty purpose of his mind to crown, / or meet sure death."
"Ecce, manus juvenem interea post terga revinctum / pastores magno ad regem clamore trahebant / Dardanidæ, qui se ignotum venientibus ultro, / hoc ipsum ut strueret Trojamque aperiet Achivis, / obtulerat, fidens animi atque in utrumque paratus, / seu versare dolos seu certæ occumbere morti. "
"Around, from far and near, / the Trojans throng, and vie the captive youth to jeer."
"Undique visendi studio Trojana juventus / circumfusa ruit, certantque illudere capto."
"Mark now the Danaans' cunning; from one wrong / learn all."
"Accipe nunc Danaum insidias, et crimine ab uno / disce omnes."
"As, scared the Phrygian ranks to see, / confused, unarmed, amid the gazing throng, / he stood, 'Alas! what spot on earth or sea / is left,' he cried, 'to shield a wretch like me, / whom Dardans seek in punishment to kill, / and Greeks disown?'"
"Namque ut conspectu in medio turbatus, inermis, / constitit, atque oculis Phrygia agmina circumspexit, / 'Heu, quæ nunc tellus,' inquit, 'quæ me æquora possunt / accipere, aut quid jam misero mihi denique restat, / cui neque apud Danaos usquam locus, et super ipsi / Dardanidæ infensi pœnas cum sanguine poscunt?'"
"Touched by his tearful plea, / we asked his race, what tidings, good or ill, / he brings, for hope, perchance, may cheer a captive still."
"Quo gemitu conversi animi, compressus et omnis / impetus. Hortamur fari, quo sanguine cretus, / quidve ferat, memoret, quæ sit fiducia capto."
You aren't my mother.
Mater mihi non es.
"Then he, at length his show of fear laid by, / 'Great King, all truly will I own, whate'er / the issue, nor my Argive race deny. / This first; if fortune, spiteful and unfair, / hath made poor Sinon wretched, fortune ne'er / shall make me false or faithless.'"
"Ille hæc, deposita tandem formidine, fatur: / 'Cuncta equidem tibi, rex, fuerit quodcumque, fatebor / vera,' inquit, 'neque me Argolica de gente negabo; / hoc primum; nec, si miserum Fortuna Sinonem / finxit, vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget.'"
'If the name / of Palamedes thou hast chanced to hear, / old Belus' progeny, if ever came / to thee or thine in talk the rumour of his fame, / whom, pure of guilt, on charges false and feigned, / wroth that his sentence should the war prevent, / by perjured witnesses the Greeks arraigned, / and doomed to die, but now his death lament.'
"Fando aliquod si forte tuas pervenit ad aures / Belidæ nomen Palamedis et inclyta fama / gloria, quem falsa sub proditione Pelasgi / insontem infando indicio, quia bella vetabat, / demisere neci, nunc cassum lumine lugent."

I'm often sleepy.

Where is my bike?
Ubi est birota mea?
"His kinsman, by a needy father sent, / with him in boyhood to the war I came."
"Illi me comitem et consanguinitate propinquum / pauper in arma pater primis huc misit ab annis. "
"And while in plenitude of power he went, / and high in princely counsels waxed his fame, / I too could boast of credit and a noble name."
"Dum stabat regno incolumis, regumque vigebat / conciliis, et nos aliquod nomemque decusque / gessimus."
"But when, through sly Ulysses' envious hate, / he left the light – alas! the tale ye know –, / stricken, I mused indignant on his fate, / and dragged my days in solitude and woe."
"Invidia postquam pellacis Ulixi / (haud ignota loquor) superis concessit ab oris, / afflictus vitam in tenebris luctuque trahebam, / et casum insontis mecum indignabar amici."
"Nor in my madness kept my purpose low, / but vowed, if e'er should happier chance invite, / and bring me home a conqueror, even so / my comrade's death with vengeance to requite. / My words aroused his wrath; thence evil's earliest blight. / Thenceforth Ulysses sought with slanderous tongue / to daunt me, scattering in the people's ear / dark hints, and looked for partners of his wrong; / nor rested, till with Calchas' aid, the seer..."
"Nec tacui demens, et me, fors si qua tulisset, / si patrios umquam remeassem victor ad Argos, / promisi ultorem, et verbis odia aspera movi. / Hinc mihi prima mali labes; hinc semper Ulixes / criminibus terrere novis, hinc spargere voces / in vulgum ambiguas, et quærere conscius arma. / Nec requievit enim, donec Calchante ministro..."
I'm strong.
Fortis sum.
"But why the thankless story should ye hear? / Why stay your hand? If Grecians in your sight / are all alike, ye know enough; take here / your vengeance. Dearly will my death delight / Ulysses, well the deed will Atreus' sons requite."
"Sed quid ego hæc autem nequidquam ingrata revolvo? / Quidve moror? Si omnes uno ordine habetis Achivos, / idque audire sat est, jamdudum sumite pœnas: / hoc Ithacus velit, et magno mercentur Atridæ."
"Then, all unknowing of Pelasgian art / and crimes so huge, the story we demand."
"Tum vero ardemus scitari et quærere causas, / ignari scelerum tantorum artisque Pelasgæ."
"And falteringly the traitor plays his part. / 'Oft, wearied by the war, the Danaans planned / to leave – and oh! had they but left – the land.'"
"Prosequitur pavitans, et ficto pectore fatur: / 'Sæpe fugam Danai Troja cupiere relicta / moliri et longo fessi discedere bello.'"
'As oft, to daunt them, in the act to fly, / storms lashed the deep, and Southern gales withstand.'
'Fecissentque utinam! Sæpe illos aspera ponti / interclusit hiems, et terruit Auster euntes.'
'And louder still, when towered the horse on high / with maple timbers, pealed the thunder through the sky.'
'Præcipue, cum jam hic trabibus contextus acernis / staret equus, toto sonuerunt æthere nimbi.'
"In doubt, we bade Eurypylus explore / Apollo's oracle, and back he brought / the dismal news: With blood, a maiden's gore, / ye stilled the winds, when Trojan shores ye sought. / With blood again must your return be bought; / an Argive victim doth the God demand."
'Suspensi Eurypylum scitantem oracula Phœbi / mittimus; isque adytis hæc tristia dicta reportat: / "Sanguine placastis ventos et virgine cæsa, / cum primum Iliacas Danai venistis ad oras; / sanguine quærendi reditus, animaque litandum / Argolica."'
"Full fast the rumour 'mong the people wrought; / cold horror chills us, and aghast we stand; / whom doth Apollo claim, whose death the Fates demand?"
"Vulgi quæ vox ut venit ad aures, / obstupuere animi, gelidusque per ima cucurrit / ossa tremor, cui fata parent, quem poscat Apollo."
"Then straight Ulysses, 'mid tumultuous cries, / drags Calchas forth, and bids the seer unfold / the dark and doubtful meaning of the skies. / Many e'en then the schemer's crime foretold, / and, silent, saw my destiny unrolled."
"Hic Ithacus vatem magno Calchanta tumultu / protrahit in medios; quæ sint ea numina divum, / flagitat: et mihi jam multi crudele canebant / artificis scelus, et taciti ventura videbant."
"Ten days the seer, as shrinking to reply / or name a victim, did the doom withhold."
"Bis quinos silet ille dies, tectusque recusat / prodere voce sua quemquam aut opponere morti."
"Then, forced by false Ulysses' clamorous cry, / spake the concerted word, and sentenced me to die."
"Vix tandem magnis Ithaci clamoribus actus, / composito rumpit vocem et me destinat aræ."
"All praised the sentence, pleased that one alone / should suffer, glad that one poor wretch should bear / the doom that each had dreaded for his own."
"Assensere omnes, et, quæ sibi quisque timebat, / unius in miseri exitium conversa tulere."
"The fatal day was come; the priests prepare / the salted meal, the fillets for may hair."
"Jamque dies infanda aderat: mihi sacra parari, / et salsæ fruges, et circum tempora vittæ."
"I fled, 'tis true, and saved my life by flight, / bursting my bonds in frenzy of despair, / and hidden in a marish lay that night, / waiting till they should sail, if sail, perchance, they might."
"Eripui, fateor, leto me, et vincula rupi, / limosoque lacu per noctem obscurus in ulva / delitui, dum vela darent, si forte dedissent."
"No hope have I my ancient fatherland, / or darling boys, or long-lost sire to see, / whom now perchance, the Danaans will demand, / poor souls! for vengeance, and their death decree, / to purge my crime, in daring to be free."
"Nec mihi jam patriam antiquam spes ulla videndi, / nec dulces natos exoptatumque parentem; / quos illi fors et pœnas ob nostra reposcent / effugia, et culpam hanc miserorum morte piabunt."
"O by the gods, who know the just and true, / by faith unstained – if any such there be –, / with mercy deign such miseries to view; / pity a soul that toils with evils all undue."
"Quod te, per superos et conscia numina veri, / per, si qua est, quæ restet adhuc mortalibus usquam, / intemerata fides, oro, miserere laborum / tantorum; miserere animi non digna ferentis."
"So, moved at length to pity by his tears, / we spare him."
"His lacrimis vitam damus, et miserescimus ultro."
"Priam bids the cords unbind, / and thus with friendly words the captive cheers:"
"Ipse viro primus manicas atque arta levari / vincla jubet Priamus, dictisque ita fatur amicis:"
"Whoe'er thou art, henceforward blot from mind / the Greeks, and leave thy miseries behind. / Ours shalt thou be; but mark, and tell me now, / what means this monster, for what use designed? / Some warlike engine? or religious vow? / Who planned the steed, and why? Come, quick, the truth avow."
"Quisquis es, amissos hinc jam obliviscere Graios: / noster eris; mihique hæc edissere vera roganti: / quo molem hanc immanis equi statuere? quis auctor? / quidve petunt? quæ religio, aut quæ machina belli?"
"Then schooled in cunning and Pelasgian sleights, / his hands unshackled to the stars he spread:"
"Dixerat. Ille, dolis instructus et arte Pelasga, / sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera palmas:"
"Ye powers inviolate, ever-burning lights! / Ye ruthless swords and altars, which I fled, / Ye sacred fillets, that adorned my head!"
"Vos, æterni ignes, et non violabile vestrum / testor numen, ait; vos, aræ ensesque nefandi, / quos fugi, vittæque deum, quas hostia gessi:"
"Freed is my oath, and I am free to lay / their secrets bare, and wish the Danaans dead."
"Fas mihi Graiorum sacrata resolvere jura, / fas odisse viros atque omnia ferre sub auras, / si qua tegunt; teneor patriæ nec legibus ullis."
Happy Easter!
Felix Pascha!
"Thou, Troy, preserved, to Sinon faithful stay, / if true the tale I tell, if large the price I pay."
"Tu modo promissis maneas, servataque serves, / Troja, fidem, si vera feram, si magna rependam."
"All hopes on Pallas, since the war begun, / all trust was stayed."
"Omnis spes Danaum et cœpti fiducia belli / Palladis auxiliis semper stetit."
"But when Ulysses, fain / to weave new crimes, with Tydeus' impious son / dragged the Palladium from her sacred fane, / and, on the citadel the warders slain, / upon the virgin's image dared to lay / red hands of slaughter, and her wreaths profane, / hope ebbed and failed them from that fatal day, / the Danaans' strength grew weak, the goddess turned away. / No dubious signs Tritonia's wrath declared."
"Impius ex quo / Tydides sed enim scelerumque inventor Ulixes, / fatale aggressi sacrato avellere templo / Palladium, cæsis summæ custodibus arcis, / corripuere sacram effigiem, manibusque cruentis / virgineas ausi divæ contingere vittas, / ex illo fluere ac retro sublapsa referri / spes Danaum, fractæ vires, aversa deæ mens. / Nec dubiis ea signa dedit Tritonia monstris."
"Scarce stood her image in the camp, when bright / with flickering flames her staring eyeballs glared. / Salt sweat ran down her; thrice, a wondrous sight! / with shield and quivering spear she sprang upright."
"Vix positum castris simulacrum, arsere coruscæ / luminibus flammæ arrectis, salsusque per artus / sudor iit, terque ipsa solo (mirabile dictu) / emicuit, parmamque ferens hastamque trementem."
"Back o'er the deep," cries Calchas; "nevermore / shall Argives hope to quell the Trojan might, / till, homeward borne, new omens ye implore, / and win the blessing back, which o'er the waves ye bore."
"Extemplo tentanda fuga canit æquora Calchas, / nec posse Argolicis exscindi Pergama telis, / omina ni repetant Argis, numenque reducant, / quod pelago et curvis secum avexere carinis."
"So now to Argos are they gone, to gain / fresh help from heaven, and hither by surprise / shall come once more, remeasuring the main. / Thus Calchas warned them."
"Et nunc, quod patrias vento petiere Mycenas, / arma deosque parant comites, pelagoque remenso / improvisi aderunt. Ita digerit omina Calchas."
"By his words made wise / this steed, for stol'n Palladium, they devise, / to soothe the outrag'd goddess."
"Hanc pro Palladio, moniti, pro numine læso / effigiem statuere, nefas quæ triste piaret."
"Tall and great, / with huge oak-timbers mounting to the skies, / they build the monster, lest it pass the gate, / and like Palladium stand, the bulwark of the State."
"Hanc tamen immensam Calchas attollere molem / roboribus textis cœloque educere jussit, / ne recipi portis aut duci in mœnia possit, / neu populum antiqua sub religione tueri."
"'Once had your hands,' said Calchas, 'dared profane / Minerva's gift, dire plagues' (which Heaven forestall / or turn on him) 'should Priam's realm sustain; / but if by Trojan aid it scaled your wall, / proud Asia then should Pelops' sons enthrall, / and children rue the folly of the sire.'"
"Nam si vestra manus violasset dona Minervæ, / tum magnum exitium (quod Di prius omen in ipsum / convertant !) Priami imperio Phrygibusque futurum ; / sin manibus vestris vestram ascendisset in urbem, / ultro Asiam magno Pelopea ad mœnia bello / venturam, et nostros ea fata manere nepotes."
His arts gave credence, and forced tears withal / snared us, whom Diomede, nor Achilles dire, / nor thousand ships subdued, nor ten years' war could tire.
Talibus insidiis perjurique arte Sinonis / credita res, captique dolis lacrimisque coactis, / quos neque Tydides, nec Larissæus Achilles, / non anni domuere decem, non mille carinæ.
A greater yet and ghastlier sign remained / our heedless hearts to terrify anew.
Hic aliud majus miseris multoque tremendum / objicitur magis, atque improvida pectora turbat.
Laocoon, Neptune's priest, by lot ordained, / a stately bull before the altar slew.
Laocoon, ductus Neptuno sorte sacerdos, / solemnes taurum ingentem mactabat ad aras.
When lo! – the tale I shudder to pursue – / from Tenedos in silence, side by side, / two monstrous serpents, horrible to view, / with coils enormous leaning on the tide, / shoreward, with even stretch, the tranquil sea divide.
Ecce autem gemini a Tenedo tranquilla per alta / (horresco referens) immensis orbibus angues / incumbunt pelago, pariterque ad litora tendunt.
Their breasts erect they rear amid the deep, / their blood-red crests above the surface shine, / their hinder parts along the waters sweep, / trailed in huge coils and many a tortuous twine.
Pectora quorum inter fluctus arrecta jubæque / sanguinæ superant undas, pars cetera pontum / ponet legit sinuatque immensa volumine terga.
Lashed into foam, behind them roars the brine; / now, gliding onward to the beach, ere long / they gain the fields, and rolling bloodshot eyne / that blaze with fire, the monsters move along, / and lick their hissing jaws, and dart a flickering tongue.
Fit sonitus, spumante salo; jamque arva tenebant; / ardentesque oculos suffecti sanguine et igni, / sibila lambebant linguis vibrantibus ora.
Pale at the sight we fly; unswerving, these / glide on and seek Laocoon. First, entwined / in stringent folds, his two young sons they seize, / with cruel fangs their tortured limbs to grind.
Diffugimus visu exsangues. Illi agmine certo / Laocoonta petunt; et primum parva duorum / corpora natorum serpens amplexus uterque / implicat, et miseros morsu depascitur artus.
Then, as with arms he comes to aid, they bind / in giant grasp the father. Twice, behold, / around his waist the horrid volumes wind, / twice round his neck their scaly backs are rolled, / high over all their heads and glittering crests unfold.
Post, ipsum, auxilio subeuntem ac tela ferentem, / corripiunt, spirisque ligant ingentibus, et jam / bis medium amplexi, bis collo squamea circum / terga dati, superant capite et cervicibus altis.
Both hands are labouring the fierce knots to pull; / black gore and slime his sacred wreaths distain. / Loud are his moans.
Ille simul manibus tendit divellere nodos, / perfusus sanie vittas atroque veneno; / clamores simul horrendos ad sidera tollit.
As when a wounded bull / shakes from his neck the faltering axe and, fain / to fly the cruel altars, roars in pain.
Quales mugitus, fugit cum saucius aram / taurus et incertam excussit cervice securim.
But lo! the serpents to Tritonia's seat / glide from their victim, till the shrine they gain, / and, coiled beside the goddess, at her feet, / behind her sheltering shield with gathered orbs retreat.
At gemini lapsu delubra ad summa dracones / effugiunt sævæque petunt Tritonidis arcem, / sub pedibusque deæ clipeique sub orbe teguntur.
Fresh wonder seized us, and we shook with fear. / All say, that justly had Laocoon died, / and paid fit penalty, whose guilty spear / profaned the steed and pierced the sacred side.
Tum vero tremefacta novus per pectora cunctis / insinuat pavor ; et scelus expendisse merentem / Laocoonta ferunt, sacrum qui cuspide robur / læserit et tergo sceleratam intorserit hastam.
'On with the image to its home', they cried, / 'and pray the Goddess to avert our woe'.
Ducendum ad sedes simulacrum, orandaque divæ / numina conclamant.
We breach the walls, and ope the town inside. / All set to work, and to the feet below / fix wheels, and hempen ropes around the neck they throw. / Mounting the walls, the monster moves along, / teeming with arms. Boys, maidens joy around / to touch the ropes, and raise the festive song.
Dividimus muros et mœnia pandimus urbis. / Accingunt omnes operi, pedibusque rotarum / subjiciunt lapsus, et stuppea vincula collo / intendunt. Scandit fatalis machina muros, / feta armis; pueri circum innuptæque puellas / sacra canunt, funemque manu contingere gaudent.
Onward it came, smooth-sliding on the ground, / an, beetling, o'er the midmost city frowned.
Illa subit, mediæque minans illabitur urbi.
O native land! O Ilion, now betrayed! / Blest home of deities, in war renowned! / Four times beside the very gate 'twas stayed; / four times within the womb the armour clashed and brayed.
O patria, o divum domus Ilium, et inclyta bello / mœnia Dardanidum!, quater ipso in limine portæ / substitit, atque utero sonitum quater arma dedere.
Tom is looking at you.
Thomas aspicit te.
Tom is always happy.
Thomas semper felix est.
But heedless, blind with frenzy, one and all / up to the sacred citadel we strain, / and there the ill-omened prodigy install.
Instamus tamen immemores cæcique furore, / et monstrum infelix sacrata sistimus arce.
E'en then – alas! to Trojan ears in vain – / Cassandra sang, and told in utterance plain / the coming doom.
Tunc etiam fatis aperit Cassandra futuris / ora, dei jussu non umquam credita Teucris.
We, sunk in careless joy, / poor souls! with festive garlands deck each fane, / and through the town in revelry employ / the day decreed our last, the dying hours of Troy!
Nos delubra deum miseri, quibus ultimus esset / ille dies, festa velamus fronde per urbem.
And now the heaven rolled round. From ocean rushed / the Night, and wrapt in shadow earth and air / and Myrmidonian wiles. In silence hushed, / the Trojans through the city here and there, / outstretched in sleep, their weary limbs repair.
Vertitur interea cœlum, et ruit oceano nox, / involvens umbra magna terramque polumque / Myrmidonumque dolos; fusi per mœnia Teucri / conticuere: sopor fessos complectitur artus.
Meanwhile from neighbouring Tenedos once more, / beneath the tranquil moonbeam's friendly care, / with ordered ships, along the deep sea-floor, / back came the Argive host, and sought the well-known shore. / Forth from the royal galley sprang the flame, / when Sinon, screened by partial Fate, withdrew / the bolts and barriers of the pinewood frame, / and from its inmost caverns, bared to view, / the fatal horse disgorged the Danaan crew.
Et jam Argiva phalanx instructis navibus ibat / a Tenedo, tacitæ per amica silentia lunæ / litora nota petens, flammas cum regia puppis / extulerat, fatisque deum defensus iniquis / inclusos utero Danaos et pinea furtim / laxat claustra Sinon.
With joy from out the hollow wood they bound; / first, dire Ulysses, with his captains two, / Thessander bold and Sthenelus renowned, / down by a pendent rope come sliding to the ground. / Then Thoas comes; and Acamas, athirst / for blood; and Neoptolemus, the heir / of mighty Peleus; and Machaon first; / and Menelaus; and himself is there, / Epeus, framer of the fatal snare.
Illos patefactus ad auras / redit equus, lætique cavo se robore promunt / Thessandrus Sthenelusque duces, et dirus Ulixes, / demissum lapsi per funem, Acamasque, Thoasque, / Pelidesque Neoptolemus, primusque Machaon, / et Menelaus, et ipse doli fabricator Epeos.
Now, stealing forward, on the town they fall, / buried in wine and sleep, the guards o'erbear, / and ope the gates; their comrades at the call / pour in and, joining bands, all muster by the wall.
Invadunt urbem somno vinoque sepultam; / cæduntur vigiles, portisque patentibus omnes / accipiunt socios atque agmina conscia jungunt.
'Twas now the time, when on tired mortals crept / first slumber, sweetest that celestials pour.
Tempus erat quo prima quies mortalibus ægris / incipit, et dono divum gratissima serpit.
Methought I saw poor Hector, as I slept, / all bathed in tears and black with dust and gore, / dragged by the chariot and his swoln feet sore / with piercing thongs.
In somnis, ecce, ante oculos mæstissimus Hector / visus adesse mihi, largosque effundere fletus, / raptatus bigis ut quondam, aterque cruento / pulvere, perque pedes trajectus lora tumentes.
Ah me! how sad to view, / how changed from him, that Hector, whom of yore / returning with Achilles' spoils we knew, / when on the ships of Greece his Phrygian fires he threw.
Hei mihi, qualis erat, quantum mutatus ab illo / Hectore, qui redit exuvias indutus Achilli, / vel Danaum Phrygios jaculatus puppibus ignes!
Please tell us where there is a grocery store.
Dic nobis, quaesimus, ubi sit taberna condimentorum.
Foul is his beard, his hair is stiff with gore, / and fresh the wounds, those many wounds, remain, / which erst around his native walls he bore.
Squalentem barbam et concretos sanguine crines, / vulneraque illa gerens, quæ circum plurima muros / accepit patrios.
Then, weeping too, I seem in sorrowing strain / to hail the hero, with a voice of pain.
Ultro flens ipse videbar / compellare virum et mæstas expromere voces:
"O light of Troy, our refuge! why and how / this long delay? Whence comest thou again, / long-looked-for Hector? How with aching brow, / worn out by toil and death, do we behold thee now! / But oh! what dire indignity hath marred / the calmness of thy features? Tell me, why / with ghastly wounds do I behold thee scarred?"
"O lux Dardaniæ, spes o fidissima Teucrum, / quæ tantæ tenuere moræ? Quibus Hector ab oris / exspectate venis? Ut te post multa tuorum / funera, post varios hominumque urbisque labores / defessi adspicimus! Quæ causa indigna serenos / fœdavit vultus, aut cur hæc vulnera cerno?"
To such vain quest he cared not to reply, / but, heaving from his breast a deep-drawn sigh, / "Fly, Goddess-born! and get thee from the fire! / The foes", he said, "are on the ramparts. Fly! / All Troy is tumbling from her topmost spire. / No more can Priam's land, nor Priam's self require."
Ille nihil, nec me quærentem vana moratur, / sed graviter gemitus imo de pectore ducens, / "Heu fuge, nate dea, teque his, ait, eripe flammis. / Hostis habet muros; ruit alta a culmine Troja. / Sat patriæ Priamoque datum."
"Could Troy be saved by mortal prowess, mine, / yea, mine had saved her."
"Si Pergama dextra / defendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent."
"To thy guardian care / she doth her Gods and ministries consign. / Take them, thy future destinies to share, / and seek for them another home elsewhere, / that mighty city, which for thee and thine / o'er traversed ocean shall the Fates prepare."
"Sacra suosque tibi commendat Troja Penates: / hos cape fatorum comites, his mœnia quære, / magna pererrato statues quæ denique ponto."
He spake, and quickly snatched from Vesta's shrine / the deathless fire and wreaths and effigy divine.
Sic ait, et manibus vittas Vestamque potentem / æternumque adytis effert penetralibus ignem.
Meanwhile a mingled murmur through the street / rolls onward – wails of anguish, shrieks of fear –, / and though my father's mansion stood secrete, / embowered in foliage, nearer and more near / peals the dire clang of arms, and loud and clear, / borne on fierce echoes that in tumult blend, / war-shout and wail come thickening on the ear.
Diverso interea miscentur mœnia luctu, / et magis atque magis, quamquam secreta parentis / Anchisæ domus arboribusque obtecta recessit, / clarescunt sonitus, armorumque ingruit horror.
I start from sleep, the parapet ascend, / and from the sloping roof with eager ears attend.
Excutior somno, et summi fastigia tecti / ascensu supero, atque arrectis auribus adsto.
Like as a fire, when Southern gusts are rude, / falls on the standing harvest of the plain, / or torrent, hurtling with a mountain flood, / whelms field and oxens' toil and smiling grain, / and rolls whole forests headlong to the main, / while, weetless of the noise, on neighbouring height, / tranced in mute wonder, stands the listening swain.
In segetem veluti cum flamma furentibus Austris / incidit, aut rapidus montano flumine torrens / sternit agros, sternit sata læta boumque labores, / præcipitesque trahit silvas; stupet inscius alto / accipiens sonitum saxi de vertice pastor.
Then, then I see that Hector's words were right, / and all the Danaan wiles are naked to the light.
Tum vero manifesta fides, Danaumque patescunt / insidiæ.
And now, Deiphobus, thy halls of pride, / bowed by the flames, come ruining through the air; / next burn Ucalegon's, and far and wide / the broad Sigean reddens with the glare.
Jam Deiphobi dedit ampla ruinam / Vulcano superante domus, jam proximus ardet / Ucalegon, Sigea igni freta lata relucent.
Then come the clamour and the trumpet's blare.
Exoritur clamorque virum clangorque tubarum.
Madly I rush to arms; though vain the fight, / yet burns my soul, in fury and despair, / to rally a handful and to hold the height: / sweet seems a warrior's death and danger a delight.
Arma amens capio; nec sat rationis in armis, / sed glomerare manum bello et concurrere in arcem / cum sociis ardent animi: furor iraque mentem / præcipitant, pulchrumque mori succurrit in armis.
Lo, Panthus, flying from the Grecian bands, / Panthus, the son of Othrys, Phoebus' seer, / bearing the sacred vessels in his hands, / and vanquished home-gods, to the door draws near, / his grandchild clinging to his side in fear.
Ecce autem telis Panthus elapsus Achivum, / Panthus Othryades, arcis Phœbique sacerdos, / sacra manu victosque deos parvumque nepotem / ipse trahit, cursuque amens ad limina tendit.
"Panthus", I cry, "how fares the fight? what tower / still hold we?"
"Quo res summa loco, Panthu? Quam prendimus arcem?"
Sighing, he replies "'Tis here, / the final end of all the Dardan power, / the last, sad day has come, the inevitable hour. / Troy was, and we were Trojans, now, alas! / no more, for perished is the Dardan fame. / Fierce Jove to Argos biddeth all to pass, / and Danaans rule a city wrapt in flame."
Vix ea fatus eram, gemitu cum talia reddit: / "Venit summa dies et ineluctabile tempus / Dardaniæ. Fuimus Troes, fuit Ilium et ingens / gloria Teucrorum; ferus omnia Jupiter Argos / transtulit, incensa Danai dominabitur in urbe."
"High in the citadel the monstrous frame / pours forth an armed deluge to the day, / and Sinon, puffed with triumph, spreads the flame. / Part throng the gates, part block each narrow way; / such hosts Mycenae sends, such thousands to the fray."
"Arduus armatos mediis in mœnibus adstans / fundit equus, victorque Sinon incendia miscet / insultans; portis alii bipatentibus adsunt, / millia quot magnis umquam venere Mycenis."
"Athwart the streets stands ready the array / of steel, and bare is every blade and bright. / Scarce the first warders of the gates essay / to stand and battle in the blinding night."
"Obsedere alii telis angusta viarum / opposit; stat ferri acies mucrone corusco / stricta, parata neci; vix primi prœlia tentant / portarum vigiles, et cæco Marte resistunt."
So spake the son of Othrys, and forthright, / my spirit stirred with impulse from on high, / I rush to arms amid the flames and fight, / where yells the war-fiend and the warrior's cry, / mixt with the din of strife, mounts upward to the sky.
Talibus Othryadæ dictis et numine divum / in flammas et in arma feror, quo tristis Erinys, / quo fremitus vocat et sublatus ad æthera clamor.
Here warlike Epytus, renowned in fight, / and valiant Rhipeus gather to our side, / and Hypanis and Dymas, matched in might, join with us, by the glimmering moon descried. / Here Mygdon's son, Coroebus, we espied, / who came to Troy, Cassandra's love to gain, / and now his troop with Priam's hosts allied; / poor youth and heedless! whom in frenzied strain / his promised bride had warned, but warned, alas! in vain.
Addunt se socios Rhipeus et maximus armis / Epytus, oblati per lunam, Hypanisque Dymasque, / et lateri agglomerant nostro, juvenisque Corœbus / Mygdonides. Illis ad Trojam forte diebus / venerat, insano Cassandræ incensus amore, / et gener auxilium Priamo Phrygibusque ferebat. / Infelix, qui non sponsæ praecepta furentis / audierit.
So when the bold and compact band I see, / "Brave hearts", I cry, "but brave, alas! in vain; / if firm your purpose holds to follow me / who dare the worst, our present plight is plain. / Troy's guardian gods have left her; altar, fane, / all is deserted, every temple bare. / The town ye aid is burning. Forward, then, / to die and mingle in the tumult's blare."
Quos ubi confertos audere in prœlia vidi; / incipio super his: "Juvenes, fortissima frustra / pectora, si vobis audentem extrema cupido / certa sequi, quæ sit rebus fortuna videtis: / excessere omnes adytis arisque relictis / di quibus imperium hoc steterat; succurritis urbi / incensæ; moriamur et in media arma ruamus."
"Sole hope to vanquished men of safety is despair."
"Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem."
Oh, who hath tears to match our grief withal? / What tongue that night of havoc can make known?
Quis cladem illius noctis, quis funera fando / explicet, aut possit lacrimis æquare labores?
An ancient city totters to her fall, / time-honoured empress and of old renown; / and senseless corpses, through the city strown, / choke house and temple.
Urbs antiqua ruit, multos dominata per annos; / plurima perque vias sternuntur inertia passim / corpora, perque domos et religiosa deorum / limina.
He is happy.
Is felix est.
Nor hath vengeance found / none save the Trojans; there the victors groan, / and valour fires the vanquished. All around / wailings, and wild affright and shapes of death abound.
Nec soli pœnas dant sanguine Teucri; / quondam etiam victis redit in præcordia virtus, / victoresque cadunt Danai. Crudelis ubique / luctus, ubique pavor et plurima mortis imago.
You're a good cat.
Bonus cattus es.
Tom and Mary are healthy, aren't they?
Nonne sunt sani Thomas et Maria?
First of the Greeks approaches, with a crowd, / Androgeus; friends he deems us unaware, / and thus, with friendly summons, cries aloud: / "Haste, comrades, forward; from the fleet ye fare / with lagging steps but now, while yonder glare / Troy's towers, and others sack and share the spoils?"
Primus se Danaum, magna comitante caterva, / Androgeos offert nobis, socia agmina credens / inscius, atque ultro verbis compellat amicis: / "Festinate, viri! Nam quæ tam sera moratur / segnities? Alii rapiunt incensa feruntque / Pergama; vos celsis nunc primum a navibus itis?"
The sky was full of stars.
Caelum plenum stellarum erat.
Then straight, for doubtful was our answer there, / he knew him taken in the foemen's toils. / Shuddering, he checks his voice, and back his foot recoils.
Dixit, et extemplo, neque enim responsa dabantur fida satis, / sensit medios delapsus in hostes. / Obstupuit, retroque pedem cum voce repressit.
The mirror is very dirty.
Speculum valde sordidum est.
As one who, in a tangled brake apart, / on some lithe snake, unheeded in the briar, / hath trodden heavily, and with backward start / flies, trembling at the head uplift in ire / and blue neck, swoln in many a glittering spire. / So slinks Androgeus, shuddering with dismay.
Improvisum aspris veluti qui sentibus anguem / pressit humi nitens, trepidusque repente refugit / attollentem iras et cærula colla tumentem; / haud secus Androgeos visu tremefactus abibat.
We, massed in onset, make the foe retire, / and slay them, wildered, weetless of the way. / Fortune, with favouring smile, assists our first essay.
Irruimus densis et circumfundimur armis, / ignarosque loci passim et formidine captos / sternimus: adspirat primo fortuna labori.
Flushed with success and eager for the fray, / "Friends," cries Coroebus, "forward; let us go / where Fortune newly smiling, points the way."
Atque hic successu exsultans animisque Corœbus / "O socii, qua prima" inquit "fortuna salutis / monstrat iter, quaque ostendit se dextra, sequamur."
"Take we the Danaans' bucklers; with a foe / who asks, if craft or courage guide the blow? / Themselves shall arm us."
"Mutemus clipeos, Danaumque insignia nobis / aptemus. Dolus, an virtus, quis in hoste requirat? / Arma dabunt ipsi."
My brother is still sleeping.
Frater meus adhuc dormit.
I called Tom to thank him.
Thoman vocavi ut ei gratias agerem.
Are you ready to start?
Tune paratus es incipere?
Then he takes the crest, / the shield and dagger of Androgeus.
Sic fatus, deinde comantem / Androgei galeam clipeique insigne decorum / induitur, laterique Argivum accommodat ensem.
So / doth Rhipeus, so brave Dymas and the rest; / all in the new-won spoils their eager limbs invest.
Hoc Rhipeus, hoc ipse Dymas omnisque juventus / læta facit: spoliis se quisque recentibus armat.
I don't think I can keep Tom from doing that.
Puto me non posse prohibere Thoman id facere.
Do you want some more milk?
Visne plus lactis?
Tom said he felt weak.
Thomas dixit se infirmum sentire.
Why isn't Tom asleep?
Cur Thomas non dormit?
Thus we, elate, but not with Heaven our friend, / march on and mingle with the Greeks in fight, / and many a Danaan to the shades we send. / And many a battle in the blinding night / we join with those that meet us.
Vadimus immixti Danais haud numine nostro, / multaque per cæcam congressi prœlia noctem / conserimus, multos Danaum demittimus Orco.
I'm not married to Tom anymore.
Jam uxor Thomasae non sum.
Some in flight / rush diverse to the ships and trusty tide; / some, craven-hearted, in ignoble fright, / make for the horse and, clambering up the side, / deep in the treacherous womb, their well-known refuge, hide.
Diffugiunt alii ad naves, et litora cursu / fida petunt; pars ingentem formidine turpi / scandunt rursus equum, et nota conduntur in alvo.
Ah! vain to boast, if Heaven refuse to aid!
Heu nihil invitis fas quemquam fidere divis!
Dragged by her tresses from Minerva's fane, / Cassandra comes, the Priameian maid, / stretching to heaven her burning eyes in vain, / her eyes, for bonds her tender hands constrain.
Ecce trahebatur passis Priameia virgo / crinibus a templo Cassandra adytisque Minervæ, / ad cœlum tendens ardentia lumina frustra, / lumina, nam teneras arcebant vincula palmas.
That sight Coroebus brooked not. Stung with gall / and mad with rage, nor fearing to be slain, / he plunged amid their columns.
Non tulit hanc speciem furiata mente Corœbus, / et sese medium injecit periturus in agmen.
I am married and have two children.
Maritus sum, et duos liberos habeo.
I am married and have two children.
Uxor sum, et duos liberos habeo.
One and all, / with weapons massed, press on and follow at his call.
Consequimur cuncti et densis incurrimus armis.
Here first with missiles, from a temple's height / hurled by our comrades, we are crushed and slain, / and piteous is the slaughter, at the sight / of Argive helms for Argive foes mista'en.
Hic primum ex alto delubri culmine telis / nostrorum obruimur, oriturque miserrima cædes / armorum facie et Graiarum errore jubarum.
Now too, with shouts of fury and disdain / to see the maiden rescued, here and there / the Danaans gathering round us, charge amain; / fierce-hearted Ajax, the Atridan pair, / and all Thessalia's host our scanty band o'erbear.
Tum Danai gemitu atque ereptæ virginis ira / undique collecti invadunt, acerrimus Ajax / et gemini Atridæ, Dolopumque exercitus omnis.
Tom told us everything.
Dixit nobis omnia Didymus.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
Cras Lutetiam eo.
I love you!
Te amo!
We have an abundance of milk.
Lacte abundamus.
We have a great deal of cheese.
Caseo abundamus.
We have plenty of honey.
Melle abundamus.
The household has an abundance of milk, cheese, and honey.
Villa et lacte et caseo et melle abundat.
The earth abounds in fruit.
Terra frumento abundat.
The city was filled with panic.
Urbs terrore impleta est.
I have friends, too.
Sunt et mihi amici.
The churches were decorated with gold.
Ecclesiae auro ornatae sunt.
The church was decorated with gold.
Ecclesia auro ornata est.
So, when the tempest bursting wakes the war, / the justling winds in conflict rave and roar, / South, West and East upon his orient car, / the lashed woods howl, and with his trident hoar / Nereus in foam upheaves the watery floor.
Adversi rupto ceu quondam turbine venti / confligunt Zephyrusque Notusque et lætus Eois / Eurus equis, stridunt silvæ, sævitque tridenti / spumeus atque imo Nereus ciet æquora fundo.
That is the house where he lives.
Illa est domus in qua habitat.
She asked me whether I can read and write.
Ea me rogavit num legere aut scribere possem.
It's not cheap.
Non vile est.
Give me some water.
Da aquam mihi.
Those too, whom late we scattered through the town, / tricked in the darkness, reappear once more. / At once the falsehood of our guise is known, / the shields, the lying arms, the speech of different tone.
Illi etiam, si quos obscura nocte per umbram / fudimus insidiis totaque agitavimus urbe, / apparent, primi clipeos mentitaque tela / agnoscunt, atque ora sono discordia signant.
Do not do that.
Noli id facere.
I thought you were going to kill me.
Putavi te me occisurum esse.
I thought he was going to kill me.
Putavi eum me occisurum esse.
I thought she was going to kill me.
Putavi eam me occisuram esse.
Here is your dog. Where is mine?
Ecce canis tuus. Ubi meus?
Don't speak with your mouth full.
Noli loqui, ore pleno.
The cat climbed up the tree.
Feles in arborem ascendit.
O'erwhelmed with odds, we perish; first of all, / struck down by fierce Peneleus by the fane / of warlike Pallas, doth Coroebus fall.
Ilicet obruimur numero; primusque Corœbus / Penelei dextra divæ armipotentis ad aram / procumbit.
Next, Rhipeus dies, the justest, but in vain, / the noblest soul of all the Trojan train. / Heaven deemed him otherwise.
Cadit et Rhipeus, justissimus unus / qui fuit in Teucris et servantissimus æqui: / dis aliter visum.
Then Dymas brave / and Hypanis by comrades' hands are slain. / Nor, Panthus, thee thy piety can save, / nor e'en Apollo's wreath preserve thee from the grave.
Pereunt Hypanisque Dymasque, / confixi a sociis, nec te tua plurima, Panthu, / labentem pietas nec Apollinis infula texit.
Sure. Do you know a good place?
Certe. Cognoscisne locum bonum?
Witness, ye ashes of our comrades dear, / ye flames of Troy, that in your hour of woe / nor darts I shunned, nor shock of Danaan spear. / If Fate my life had called me to forego, / this hand had earned it, forfeit to the foe.
Iliaci cineres et flamma extrema meorum, / testor, in occasu vestro nec tela nec ullas / vitavisse vices Danaum, et, si fata fuissent, / ut caderem, meruisse manu.
Thence forced away, brave Iphitus, and I, / and Pelias – Iphitus with age was slow, / and Pelias by Ulysses lamed.
Divellimur inde: / Iphitus et Pelias mecum, quorum Iphitus ævo / jam gravior, Pelias et vulnere tardus Ulixi.
I'm not a liar.
Mendax non sum.
Tom was the only one sitting.
Thomas erat solus qui sedebat.
Here are some letters for you.
Ecce adsunt tibi epistulae.
I want to think about it.
De hoc cogitare volo.
I told you so.
Sic tibi dixi.
We are expecting a baby.
Infantem exspectamus.
We fly / where round the palace rings the war-shout's rallying cry. / There raged a fight so fierce, as though no fight / raged elsewhere, nor the city streamed with gore.
Protinus ad sedes Priami clamore vocati. / Hic vero ingentem pugnam, ceu cetera nusquam / bella forent, nulli tota morerentur in urbe.
He expressed his thanks to us all.
Gratias omnibus nobis reddidit.
We chose him to be our leader.
Eum ducem nostrum elegimus.
We see the War-God glorying in his might; / up to the roof we see the Danaos pour; / their shielded penthouse drives against the door.
Sic Martem indomitum Danaosque ad tecta ruentes / cernimus, obsessumque acta testudine limen.
Close cling their ladders to the walls; these, fain / to clutch the doorposts, climb from floor to floor, / their right hands strive the battlements to gain, / their left with lifted shield the arrowy storm sustain.
Hærent parietibus scalæ, postesque sub ipsos / nituntur gradibus, clipeosque ad tela sinistris / protecti objiciunt, prensant fastigia dextris.
Go and sit by your father.
I, sede apud patrem tuum.
There, roof and pinnacle the Dardans tear – / death standing near – and hurl them on the foe, / last arms of need, the weapons of despair; / and gilded beams and rafters down they throw, / ancestral ornaments of days ago.
Dardanidæ contra turres ac tecta domorum / culmina convellunt; his se, quando ultima cernunt, / extrema jam in morte parant defendere telis, / auratasque trabes, veterum decora alta parentum, / devolvunt.
These, stationed at the gates, with naked glaive, / shoulder to shoulder, guard the pass below. / Hearts leap afresh the royal halls to save, / and cheer our vanquished friends and reinspire the brave.
Alii strictis mucronibus imas / obsedere fores; has servant agmine denso. / Instaurati animi, regis succurrere tectis, / auxilioque levare viros, vimque addere victis.
Behind the palace, unobserved and free, / there stood a door, a secret thoroughfare / through Priam's halls. Here poor Andromache / while Priam's kingdom flourished and was fair, / to greet her husband's parents would repair / alone, or carrying with tendance fain / to Hector's father Hector's son and heir.
Limen erat cæcæque fores et pervius usus / tectorum inter se Priami, postesque relicti / a tergo, infelix qua se, dum regna manebant, / sæpius Andromache ferre incomitata solebat / ad soceros, et avo puerum Astyanacta trahebat.
That thing doesn't work.
Istud non fungitur.
By this I reached the roof-top, whence in vain / the luckless Teucrians hurled their unavailing rain.
Evado ad summi fastigia culminis, unde / tela manu miseri jactabant irrita Teucri.
Have a nice day.
Bonam diem.
Tell Tom you can't do it.
Dic Thomae te non posse id facere.
Tom says he'll call Mary next week.
Thomas dicit se Mariam proxima hebdomade vocaturum esse.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Hic color Thomae non placet.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Thomas hunc colorem non amat.
Sheer o'er the highest roof-top to the sky, / skirting the parapet, a watch-tower rose, / whence camp and fleet and city met the eye.
Turrim, in præcipiti stantem summisque sub astra / eductam tectis, unde omnis Troja videri / et Danaum solitæ naves et Achaica castra.
Here plying levers, where the flooring shows / weak joists, we heave it over.
Aggressi ferro circum, qua summa labantes / juncturas tabulata dabant, convellimus altis / sedibus impulimusque.
Down it goes / with sudden crash upon the Danaan train, / dealing wide ruin.
Ea lapsa repente ruinam / cum sonitu trahit et Danaum super agmina late / incidit.
But anon new foes / come swarming up, while ever and again / fast fall the showers of stones, and thick the javelins rain.
Ast alii subeunt, nec saxa nec ullum / telorum interea cessat genus.
Just on the threshold of the porch, behold / fierce Pyrrhus stands, in glittering brass bedight.
Vestibulum ante ipsum primoque in limine Pyrrhus / exsultat, telis et luce coruscus ahena.
As when a snake, that through the winter's cold / lay swoln and hidden in the ground from sight, / gorged with rank herbs, forth issues to the light, / and sleek with shining youth and newly drest, / wreathing its slippery volumes, towers upright / and, glorying, to the sunbeam rears its breast, / and darts a three-forked tongue, and points a flaming crest.
Qualis ubi in lucem coluber mala gramina pastus, / frigida sub terra tumidum quem bruma tegebat, / nunc positis novus exuviis nitidusque juventa, / lubrica convolvit sublato pectore terga, / arduus ad solem, et linguis micat ore trisulcis.
With him, Achilles' charioteer and squire, / Automedon, huge Periphas and all / the Scyrian youth rush up, and flaming fire / hurl to the roof, and thunder at the wall.
Una ingens Periphas et equorum agitator Achillis, / armiger Automedon, una omnis Scyria pubes / succedunt tecto, et flammas ad culmina jactant.
Tom lives in the country.
Didymus ruri vivit.
Are you at home?

Libros e domo tua misisti.
We live in house number fifty, next to the market.

When he heard the noise, Tom quickly ran out of the house.
Audito sonitu, Thomas e domo celeriter cucurrit.
Go home.
Domum ite.
I was going home.
Domum ibam.
Go home.
Domum i.

You hate Tom, right?
Nonne odisti Thoman?
I thought you hated Tom.
Te Thoman odisse putavi.
This is not a pipe.
Hoc fumisugium non est.
This is not a pipe.
Hoc infumibulum non est.
This is not a pipe.
Haec pipa non est.
He in the forefront, tallest of the tall, / poleaxe in hand, unhinging at a stroke / the brazen portals, made the doorway fall, / and wide-mouthed as a window, through the oak, / a panelled plank hewn out, a yawning rent he broke.
Ipse inter primos correpta dura bipenni / limina perrumpit, postesque a cardine vellit / æratos; jamque excisa trabe firma cavavit / robora, et ingentem lato dedit ore fenestram.
Are they selling their house?
Venduntne domum suam?
He built a new house.
Domum novam aedificavit.
When will you come home?
Quando domum venies?
I want to go home.
Domum ire volo.
Bared stands the inmost palace, and behold, / the stately chambers and the courts appear / of Priam and the Trojan Kings of old, / and warders at the door with shield an spear.
Apparet domus intus, et atria longa patescunt ; / apparent Priami et veterum penetralia regum, / armatosque vident stantes in limine primo.
Moaning and tumult in the house we hear, / wailings of misery, and shouts that smite / the golden stars, and women's shrieks of fear, / and trembing matrons, hurrying left and right, / cling to and kiss the doors, made frantic by affright.
At domus interior gemitu miseroque tumultu / miscetur, penitusque cavæ plangoribus ædes / femineis ululant, ferit aurea sidera clamor. / Tum pavidæ tectis matres ingentibus errant, / amplexæque tenent postes atque oscula figunt.
My children live in Athens.

Litteras tuas accepi.
We'll visit you.
Te visitabimus.
Strong as his father, Pyrrhus onward pushed, / nor bars nor warders can his strength sustain. / Down sinks the door, with ceaseless battery crushed.
Instat vi patria Pyrrhus; nec claustra neque ipsi / custodes sufferre valent: labat ariete crebro / janua, et emoti procumbunt cardine postes.
Stressed is our heart till it rests in you.
Inquietum es cor nostrum donec requiescat in te.
Force wins a footing, and, the foremost slain, / in, like a deluge, pours the Danaan train.
Fit via vi: rumpunt aditus, primosque trucidant / immissi Danai, et late loca milite complent.
So when the foaming river, uncontrolled, / bursts through its banks and riots on the plain, / o'er dyke and dam the gathering deluge rolled, / from field to field sweeps on with cattle, flock and fold.
Non sic, aggeribus ruptis cum spumeus amnis / exiit oppositasque evicit gurgite moles, / fertur in arva furens cumulo, camposque per omnes / cum stabulis armenta trahit.
I've been living here for many years.
Hic multos annos habitavi.
Who's going to stop me?
Quis me prohibebit?
Tom says he wants to meet you.
Thomas dicit se velle tecum congredi.
What was stolen?
Quid sublatum est?
These eyes saw Pyrrhus, rioting in blood, / saw on the threshold the Atridae twain.
Vidi ipse furentem / cæde Neoptolemum geminosque in limine Atridas.
Saw where among a hundred daughters, stood / pale Hecuba, saw Priam's life-blood stain / the fires his hands had hallowed in the fane.
Vidi Hecubam centumque nurus, Priamumque per aras / sanguine fœdantem, quos ipse sacraverat, ignes.
Those fifty bridal chambers I behold / (so fair the promise of a future reign) / and spoil-deckt pillars of barbaric gold, / a wreck; where fails the flame, its place the Danaans hold.
Quinquaginta illi thalami, spes tanta nepotum, / barbarico postes auro spoliisque superbi, / procubuere; tenent Danai, qua deficit ignis.
I don't have the strength to keep trying.
Perpetuo contendere non valeo.
Haply the fate of Priam thou would'st know.
Forsitan et, Priami fuerint quæ fata, requiras.
Soon as he saw the captured city fall, / the palace-gates burst open, and the foe / dealing wild riot in his inmost hall, / up sprang the old man and, at danger's call, / braced o'er his trembling shoulders in a breath / his rusty armour, took his belt withal, / and drew the useless falchion from its sheath, / and on their thronging spears rushed forth to meet his death.
Urbis uti captæ casum convulsaque vidit / limina tectorum et medium in penetralibus hostem, / arma diu senior desueta trementibus ævo / circumdat nequidquam humeris, et inutile ferrum / cingitur, ac densos fertur moriturus in hostes.
Within the palace, open to the day, / there stood a massive altar. Overhead, / with drooping boughs, a venerable bay / its shadowy foliage o'er the home-gods spread.
Aedibus in mediis nudoque sub ætheris axe / ingens ara fuit, juxtaque veterrima laurus, / incumbens aræ atque umbra complexa Penates.
Here, with her hundred daughters, pale with dread, / poor Hecuba and all her female train, / as doves, that from the low'ring storm have fled, / and cower for shelter from the pelting rain, / crouch round the silent gods, and cling to them in vain.
Hic Hecuba et natæ nequidquam altaria circum, / præcipites atra ceu tempestate columbæ, / condensæ et divum amplexæ simulacra sedebant.
But when in youthful arms came Priam near, / "Ah, hapless lord!" she cries, "what mad desire / arms thee for battle? Why this sword and spear? / And whither art thou hurrying?"
Ipsum autem sumptis Priamum juvenalibus armis / ut vidit, "Quæ mens tam dira, miserrime conjux, / impulit his cingi telis, aut quo ruis?" inquit.
"Times so dire / not such defenders nor such help require. / Not e'en, were Hector here, my Hector's aid / could save us."
"Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis / tempus eget; non, si ipse meus nunc afforet Hector."
"Hither to this shrine retire, / and share our safety or our death."
"Huc tandem concede: hæc ara tuebitur omnes, / aut moriere simul."
She said, / and to his hallowed seat the aged monarch led.
Sic ore effata, recepit / ad sese et sacra longævum in sede locavit.
See, now, Polites, one of Priam's sons, / scarce slipt from Pyrrhus' butchery, and lame, / through foes, through darts, along the cloisters runs / and empty courtyards.
Ecce autem elapsus Pyrrhi de cæde Polites, / unus natorum Priami, per tela, per hostes / porticibus longis fugit, et vacua atria lustrat / saucius.
At his heels, aflame / with rage, comes Pyrrhus. Lo, in act to aim, / now, now, he clutches him, – a moment more, / e'en as before his parent's eyes he came, / the long spear reached him. Prostrate on the floor / down falls the hapless youth, and welters in his gore.
Illum ardens infesto vulnere Pyrrhus / insequitur, jam jamque manu tenet et premit hasta; / ut tandem ante oculos evasit et ora parentum. / Concidit ac multo vitam cum sanguine fudit.
Then Priam, though hemmed with death on every side, / spared not his utterance, nor his wrath controlled.
Hic Priamus, quamquam in media jam morte tenetur, / non tamen abstinuit, nec voci iræque pepercit.
"To thee, yea, thee, fierce miscreant", he cried, / may Heaven, if Heaven with righteous eyes behold / so foul an outrage and a deed so bold, / ne'er fail a fitting guerdon to ordain, / nor worthy quittance for thy crime withhold, / whose hand hath made me see my darling slain, / and dared with filial blood a father's eyes profane."
"At tibi pro scelere", exclamat, "pro talibus ausis / di, si qua est cœlo pietas, quæ talia curet, / persolvant grates dignas et præmia reddant / debita, qui nati coram me cernere letum / fecisti et patrios fœdasti funere vultus."
He's very fond of science fiction.
Fictio scientifica ei valde placet.
It's been a long night.
Fuit nox longa.
I'm sure we can trust Tom.
Certus sum nos Thomae credere posse.
Tell me where I can find Tom.
Dic mihi quo Thoman invenire possim.
"Not so Achilles, whom thy lying tongue / would feign thy father; like a foeman brave, / he scorned a suppliant's rights and trust to wrong, / and sent me home in safety, – ay, and gave / my Hector's lifeless body to the grave."
"At non ille, satum quo te mentiris, Achilles / talis in hoste fuit Priamo, sed jura fidemque / supplicis erubuit, corpusque exsangue sepulcro / reddidit Hectorem, meque in mea regna remisit."
The old man spoke and, with a feeble throw, / at Pyrrhus with a harmless dart he drave. / The jarring metal blunts it, and below / the shield-boss, down it hangs, and foils the purposed blow.
Sic fatus senior, telumque imbelle sine ictu / conjecit, rauco quod protinus aere repulsum / et summo clipei nequidquam umbone pependit.
"Go then", cries Pyrrhus, "with thy tale of woe / to dead Pelides, and thy plaints outpour. / To him, my father, in the shades below, / these deeds of his degenerate son deplore."
Cui Pyrrhus: "Referes ergo hæc et nuntius ibis / Pelidæ genitori; illi mea tristia facta / degeneremque Neoptolemum narrare memento."
"Now die!" – So speaking, to the shrine he tore / the aged Priam, trembling with affright, / and feebly sliding in his son's warm gore. / The left hand twists his hoary locks; the right / deep in his side drives home the falchion, bared and bright.
"Nunc morere." Hoc dicens, altaria ad ipsa trementem / traxit et in multo lapsantem sanguine nati, / implicuitque comam læva, dextraque coruscum / extulit ac lateri capulo tenus abdidit ensem.
Such close had Priam's fortunes; so his days / were finished, such the bitter end he found, / now doomed by Fate with dying eyes to gaze / on Troy in flames and ruin all around, / and Pergamus laid level with the ground. / Lo, he to whom once Asia bowed the knee, / proud lord of many peoples, far-renowned, / now left to welter by the rolling sea, / a huge and headless trunk, a nameless corpse is he.
Hæc finis Priami fatorum; hic exitus illum / sorte tulit, Trojam incensam et prolapsa videntem / Pergama, tot quondam populis terrisque superbum / regnatorem Asiæ. Jacet ingens litore truncus, / avulsumque humeris caput et sine nomine corpus.
Is anyone going to eat that?
Aliquisne illud edet?
I'm married to Tom.
Uxor Thomasae sum.
There's a book lying open on the desk.
Liber apertus super mensam scriptoriam est.
Grim horror seized me, and aghast I stood.
At me tum primum sævus circumstetit horror.
Uprose the image of my father dear, / as there I see the monarch, bathed in blood, / like him in prowess and in age his peer. / Uprose Creusa, desolate and drear, / Iulus' peril, and a plundered home.
Obstupui; subiit cari genitoris imago, / ut regem æquævum crudeli vulnere vidi / vitam exhalantem; subiit deserta Creusa / et direpta domus et parvi casus Iuli.
I look around for comrades; none are near. / Some o'er the battlements leapt headlong, some / sank fainting in the flames; the final hour was come.
Respicio et, quæ sit me circum copia, lustro. / Desuere omnes defessi, et corpora saltu / ad terram misere aut ignibus ægra dedere.
I stood alone, when lo, in Vesta's fane / I see Tyndarean Helen, crouching down. / Bright shone the blaze around me, as in vain / I tracked my comrades through the burning town.
Jamque adeo super unus eram, cum limina Vestæ / servantem et tacitam secreta in sede latentem / Tyndarida adspicio: dant clara incendia lucem / erranti passimque oculos per cuncta ferenti.
There, mute, and, as the traitress deemed, unknown, / dreading the Danaan's vengeance, and the sword / of Trojans, wroth for Pergamus o'erthrown, / dreading the anger of her injured lord, / sat Troy's and Argos' fiend, twice hateful and abhorred.
Illa sibi infestos eversa ob Pergama Teucros, / et pœnas Danaum et deserti conjugis iras / præmetuens, Trojæ et patriæ communis Erinys, / abdiderat sese atque aris invisa sedebat.
Then, fired with passion and revenge, I burn / to quit Troy's downfall and exact the fee / such crimes deserve.
Exarsere ignes animo, subit ira cadentem / ulcisci patriam et sceleratas sumere pœnas.
Sooth, then, shall she return / to Sparta and Mycenae, ay, and see / home, husband, sons and parents, safe and free, / with Ilian wives and Phrygians in her train, / a queen, in pride of triumph? Shall this be, / and Troy have blazed and Priam's self been slain, / and Trojan blood so oft have soaked the Dardan plain?
Scilicet hæc Spartam incolumis patriasque Mycenas / adspiciet, partoque ibit regina triumpho, / conjugiumque domumque patres natosque videbit, / Iliadum turba et Phrygiis comitata ministris? / Occiderit ferro Priamus, Troja arserit igni, / Dardanium toties sudarit sanguine litus?
Nobody lives forever.
Nemo vivit aeterne.
"Not so; though glory wait not on the act; / though poor the praise, and barren be the gain, / vengeance on feeble woman to exact, / yet praised hereafter shall his name remain, / who purges earth of such a monstrous stain. / Sweet is the passion of vindictive joy, / sweet is the punishment, where just the pain, / sweet the fierce ardour of revenge to cloy, / and slake with Dardan blood the funeral flames of Troy."
"Non ita; namque etsi nullum memorabile nomen / feminea in pœna est, nec habet victoria laudem, / exstinxisse nefas tamen et sumpsisse merentis / laudabor pœnas, animumque explesse juvabit / ultricis flammæ et cineres satiasse meorum."
So mused I, blind with anger, when in light / apparent, never so refulgent seen, / my mother dawned irradiate on the night, / confessed a Goddess, such her form, and mien / and starry stature of celestial sheen. / With her right hand she grasped me from above, / and thus with roseate lips:
Talia jactabam et furiata mente ferebar, / cum mi se, non ante oculis tam clara, videndam / obtulit et pura per noctem in luce refulsit / alma parens, confessa deam, qualisque videri / cœlicolis et quanta solet, dextraque prehensum / continuit, roseoque hæc insuper addidit ore:
"O son, what mean / these transports? Say, what bitter grief doth move / thy soul to rage untamed? Where vanished is thy love?"
"Nate, quis indomitas tantus dolor excitat iras? / Quid furis, aut quonam nostri tibi cura recessit?"
"Wilt thou not see, if yet thy sire survive, / worn out with age, amid the war's alarms? / And if thy wife Creusa be alive, / and young Ascanius? for around thee swarms / the foe, and but for my protecting arms, / fierce sword or flame had swept them all away."
"Non prius adspicies, ubi fessum ætate parentem / liqueris Anchisen, superet conjuxne Creusa / Ascaniusque puer, quos omnes undique Graiæ / circum errant acies, et, ni mea cura resistat, / jam flammæ tulerint inimicus et hauserit ensis."
Tom has not had an easy life.
Vita Thomasae facilis non erat.
"Not oft-blamed Paris, nor the hateful charms / of Helen; Heaven, unpitying Heaven to-day / hath razed the Trojan towers and reft the Dardan sway."
"Non tibi Tyndaridis facies invisa Lacænæ / culpatusve Paris, divum inclementia, divum, / has evertit opes sternitque a culmine Trojam."
"Look now, for I will clear the mists that shroud / thy mortal gaze, and from the visual ray / purge the gross covering of this circling cloud. / Thou heed, and fear not, whatsoe'er I say, / nor scorn thy mother's counsels to obey."
"Adspice, namque omnem, quæ nunc obducta tuenti / mortales hebebat visus tibi et humida circum / caligat, nubem eripiam: tu ne qua parentis / jussa time, neu præceptis parere recusa!"
"Here, where thou seest the riven piles o'erthrown, / mixt dust and smoke, rock torn from rock away, / great Neptune's trident shakes the bulwarks down, / and from its lowest base uproots the trembling town."
"Hic ubi disjectas moles avulsaque saxis / saxa vides mistoque undantem pulvere fumum, / Neptunus muros magnoque emota tridenti / fundamenta quatit, totamque a sedibus urbem / eruit."
"Here, girt with steel, the foremost in the fight, / fierce Juno stands, the Scaean gates before, / and, mad with fury and malignant spite, / calls up her federate forces from the shore."
"Hic Juno Scæas sævissima portas / prima tenet, sociumque furens a navibus agmen / ferro accincta vocat. "
"See, on the citadel, all grim with gore, / red-robed, and with the Gorgon shield aglow, / Tritonian Pallas bids the conflict roar."
"Jam summas arces Tritonia, respice, Pallas / insedit, nimbo effulgens et Gorgone sæva."
French is a very beautiful language.
Lingua Gallica valde pulchra est.
'"E'en Jove with strength reanimates the foe, / and stirs the powers of heaven to work the Dardan's woe."
"Ipse pater Danais animos viresque secundas / sufficit, ipse deos in Dardana suscitat arma."
"Haste, son, and fly; the fruitless toil give o'er. / I will not leave thee, but assist thy flight, / and set thee safely at thy father's door."
"Eripe, nate, fugam, finemque impone labori. / Nusquam abero, et tutum patrio te limine sistam."
She spake, and vanished in the gloom of night.
Dixerat, et spissis noctis se condidit umbris.
Dread shapes and forms terrific loomed in sight, / and hostile deities, whose faces frowned / destruction.
Apparent diræ facies inimicaque Trojæ / numina magna deum.
Then, amid the lurid light, / I see Troy sinking in the flames around, / and mighty Neptune's walls laid level with the ground.
Tum vero omne mihi visum considere in ignes / Ilium et ex imo verti Neptunia Troja.
There are islands in the sea.
In mari insulae sunt.
Where are Tom and Mary?
Thomas et Maria ubi sunt?
Is Tom alive?
Num Thomas vivus est?
So, when an aged ash on mountain tall / stout woodmen strive, with many a rival blow, / to rend from earth; awhile it threats to fall, / with quivering locks and nodding head; now slow / it sinks and, with a dying groan lies low, / and spreads its ruin on the mountain side.
Ac veluti summis antiquam in montibus ornum / cum ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant / eruere agricolæ certatim; illa usque minatur / et tremefacta comam concusso vertice nutat, / vulneribus donec paulatim evicta supremum / congemuit traxitque jugis avulsa ruinam.
Down from the citadel I haste below, / through foe, through fire, the goddes for my guide. / Harmless the darts give way, the sloping flames divide.
Descendo, ac ducente deo flammam inter et hostes / expedior: dant tela locum, flammæque recedunt.
But when Anchises' ancient home I gain, / my father, he, whom first, with loving care, / I sought and, heedful of my mother, fain / in safety to the neighbouring hills would bear, / disdains Troy's ashes to outlive and wear / his days in banishment.
Atque ubi jam patriæ perventum ad limina sedis / antiquasque domos, genitor, quem tollere in altos / optabam primum montes primumque petebam, / abnegat excisa vitam producere Troja / exsiliumque pati.
"Fly ye, who may, / whom age hath chilled not, nor the years impair."
"Vos o, quibus integer ævi / sanguis, ait, solidæque suo stant robore vires, / vos agitate fugam."
"For me, had Heaven decreed a longer day, / Heaven too had spared these walls, nor left my home a prey."
"Me si cœlicolæ voluissent ducere vitam, / has mihi servassent sedes."
"Enough and more, to live when Ilion fell, / and once to see Troy captured."
"Satis una superque / vidimus excidia et captæ superavimus urbi."
"Leave me, pray, / and bid me, as a shrouded corpse, farewell. / For death, this hand will find for me the way, / or foes who spoil will pity me and slay. / Light is the loss of sepulchre or pyre."
"Sic o, sic positum affati discedit corpus. / Ipse manu mortem inveniam; miserebitur hostis / exuviasque petet. Facilis jactura sepulcri."
"Loathed have I lived and useless, since the day / when man's great monarch and the God's dread sire / breathed his avenging blast and scathed me with his fire."
"Jam pridem invisus divis et inutilis annos / demoror, ex quo me divum pater atque hominum rex / fulminis afflavit ventis et contigit igni."
So spake he, on his purpose firmly bent. / We – wife, child, family and I – with prayer / and tears entreat the father to relent, / nor doom us all the common wreck to share, / and urge the ruin that the Fates prepare.
Talia perstabat memorans, fixusque manebat. / Nos contra effusi lacrimis, conjuxque Creusa / Ascaniusque, omnisque domus, ne vertere secum / cuncta pater, fatoque urgenti incumbere, vellet.
He heeds not – stirs not.
Abnegat, inceptoque et sedibus hæret in isdem.
Then again I fly / to arms – to arms, in frenzy of despair, / and long in utter misery to die. / What other choice was left, what other chance to try?
Rursus in arma feror, mortemque miserrimus opto. / Nam quod consilium aut quæ jam fortuna dabatur?
"What, I to leave thee helpless, and to flee? / O father! could'st thou fancy it? Could e'er / a parent speak of such a crime to me?"
"Mene efferre pedem, genitor, te posse relicto / sperasti, tantumque nefas patrio excidit ore?"
"If Heaven of such a city naught should spare, / and thou be pleased that thou and thine should share / the common wreck, that way to death is plain. / Wide stands the door; soon Pyrrhus will be there, / red with the blood of Priam; he hath slain / the son before his sire, the father in the fane."
"Si nihil ex tanta superis placet urbe relinqui, / et sedet hoc animo, perituræque addere Trojæ / teque tuosque juvat; patet isti janua leto, / jamque aderit multo Priami de sanguine Pyrrhus, / natum ante ora patris, patrem qui obtruncat ad aras."

I'm waiting for my mother.
Matrem meam exspecto.
"Dost thou for this, dear mother, me through fire / and foeman safely to my home restore; / to see Creusa, and my son and sire / each foully butchered in the other's gore, / and Danaans dealing slaughter at the door?"
"Hoc erat, alma parens, quod me per tela, per ignes / eripis, ut mediis hostem in penetralibus, utque / Ascanium patremque meum juxtaque Creusam, / alterum in alterius mactatos sanguine cernam?"
"Arms – bring me arms! Troy's dying moments call / the vanquished. Give me to the Greeks. Once more / let me revive the battle; ne'er shall all / die unrevenged this day, nor tamely meet their fall."
"Arma, viri, ferte arma: vocat lux ultima victos! / Reddite me Danais! Sinite instaurata revisam / prœlia! Numquam omnes hodie moriemur inulti."
Once more I girt me with the sword and shield, / and forth had soon into the battle hied, / when lo, Creusa at the doorway kneeled, / and reached Iulus to his sire and cried:
Hinc ferro accingor rursus, clipeoque sinistram / insertabam aptans meque extra tecta ferebam; / ecce autem complexa pedes in limine conjux / hærebat, parvumque patri tendebat Iulum.
I shouldn't have lost my temper.
Me non oportuit irascere.
We have a dog.
Canem habemus.
It was very scary.
Horrificum erat.
"If death thou seekest, take me at thy side / thy death to share, but if, expert in strife, / thou hop'st in arms, here guard us and abide. / To whom dost thou expose Iulus' life, / thy father's, yea, and mine, once called, alas! thy wife?"
"Si periturus abis, et nos rape in omnia tecum; / sin aliquam expertus sumptis spem ponis in armis, / hanc primum tutare domum. Cui parvus Iulus, / cui pater et conjux quondam tua dicta relinquor?"
So wailed Creusa, and in wild despair / filled all the palace with her sobs and cries, / when lo! a portent, wondrous to declare. / For while, 'twixt sorrowing parents' hands and eyes, / stood young Iulus, wildered with surprise, / up from the summit of his fair, young head / a tuft was seen of flickering flame to rise. / Gently and harmless to the touch it spread / around his tender brows, and on his temples fed.
Talia vociferans gemitu tectum omne replebat, / cum subitum dictuque oritur mirabile monstrum. / Namque manus inter mæstorumque ora parentum / ecce levis summo de vertice visus Iuli / fundere lumen apex, tactuque innoxia molles / lambere flamma comas et circum tempora pasci.
In haste we strive to quench the flame divine, / shaking the tresses of his burning hair.
Nos pavidi trepidare metu, crinemque flagrantem / excutere et sanctos restinguere fontibus ignes.
But gladly sire Anchises hails the sign, / and gazing upward through the starlit air, / his hands and voice together lifts in prayer: / "O Jove omnipotent, dread power benign, / if aught our piety deserve, if e'er / a suppliant move thee, hearken and incline / this once, and aid us now and ratify thy sign."
At pater Anchises oculos ad sidera lætus / extulit, et cœlo palmas cum voce tetendit : / "Jupiter omnipotens, precibus si flecteris ullis, / adspice nos: hoc tantum; et, si pietate meremur, / da deinde auxilium, pater, atque hæc omina firma."
You must be more careful from now on.
Post hoc oportet te diligentius agere.
Mary has a flower in her hair.
Maria florem in capillis suis habet.
Go now.
I nunc.
Go now.
Ite nunc.
Scarce spake the sire when lo, to leftward crashed / a peal of thunder, and amid the night / a sky-dropt star athwart the darkness flashed, / trailing its torchfire with a stream of light.
Vix ea fatus erat senior, subitoque fragore / intonuit lævum, et de cœlo lapsa per umbras / stella facem ducens multa cum luce cucurrit.
We mark the dazzling meteor in its flight / glide o'er the roof, till, vanished from our eyes, / it hides in Ida's forest, shining bright / and furrowing out a pathway through the skies, / and round us far and wide the sulphurous fumes arise.
Illam, summa super labentem culmina tecti, / cernimus Idæa claram se condere silva, / signantemque vias; tum longo limite sulcus / dat lucem, et late circum loca sulfure fumant.
Up rose my sire, submissive to the sign, / and briefly to the Gods addressed his prayer, / and bowed adoring to the star divine.
Hic vero victus genitor se tollit ad auras, / affaturque deos et sanctum sidus adorat.
"Now, now," he cries, "no tarrying; wheresoe'er / ye point the path, I follow and am there. / Gods of my fathers! O preserve to-day / my home, preserve my grandchild; for your care / is Troy, and yours this omen. I obey; / lead on, my son, I yield and follow on thy way."
"Jam jam nulla mora est; sequor et, qua ducitis, adsum. / Di patrii, servate domum, servate nepotem! / Vestrum hoc augurium,vestroque in numine Troja est. / Cedo equidem nec, nate, tibi comes ire recuso."
He spake, and nearer through the city came / the roar, the crackle and the fiery glow / of conflagration, rolling floods of flame.
Dixerat ille, et jam per mœnia clarior ignis / auditur, propiusque æstus incendia volvunt.
"Quick, father, mount my shoulders, let us go. / That toil shall never tire me."
"Ergo age, care pater, cervici imponere nostræ; / ipse subibo humeris, nec me labor iste gravabit."
Are the children asleep?
Num liberi dormiunt?
"Come whatso / the Fates shall bring us, both alike shall share / one common welfare or one common woe."
"Quo res cumque cadent, unum et commune periclum, / una salus ambobus erit."
"Let young Iulus at my side repair; / keep thou, my wife, aloof, and follow as we fare."
"Mihi parvus Iulus / sit comes, et longe servet vestigia conjux."
"Ye too, my servants, hearken my commands. / Outside the city is a mound, where, dear / to Ceres once, but now deserted, stands / a temple, and an aged cypress near, / for ages hallowed with religious fear."
"Vos, famuli, quæ dicam, animis advertite vestris. / Est urbe egressis tumulus templumque vetustum / desertæ Cereris, juxtaque antiqua cupressus / religione patrum multos servata per annos."
There meet we.
"Hanc ex diverso sedem veniemus in unam."
"Father, in thy charge remain / Troy's gods; for me, red-handed with the smear / of blood, and fresh from slaughter, 'twere profane / to touch them, ere the stream hath cleansed me of the stain."
"Tu, genitor, cape sacra manu patriosque Penates; / me bello e tanto digressum et cæde recenti / attrectare nefas, donec me flumine vivo / abluero."
So saying, my neck and shoulders I incline, / and round them fling a lion's tawny hide, / then lift the load.
Hæc fatus, latos humeros subjectaque colla / veste super fulvique insternor pelle leonis, / succedoque oneri.
His little hand in mine, / Iulus totters at his father's side; / behind me comes Creusa.
Dextræ se parvus Iulus / implicuit sequiturque patrem non passibus æquis; / pone subit conjux.
On we stride / through shadowy ways; and I who rushing spear / and thronging foes but lately had defied, / now fear each sound, each whisper of the air, / trembling for him I lead, and for the charge I bear.
Ferimur per opaca locorum; / et me, quem dudum non ulla injecta movebant / tela neque adverso glomerati ex agmine Graii, / nunc omnes terrent auræ, sonus excitat omnis / suspensum et pariter comitique onerique timentem.
And now I neared the gates, and thought my flight / achieved, when suddenly a noise we hear / of trampling feet, and, peering through the night, / my father cries, "Fly, son, the Greeks are near; / they come, I see the glint of shield and spear, / fierce foes in front and flashing arms behind."
Jamque propinquabam portis omnemque videbar / evasisse viam, subito cum creber ad aures / visus adesse pedum sonitus, genitorque per umbram / prospiciens "Nate", exclamat, "fuge, nate, propinquant. / Ardentes clipeos atque æra micantia cerno."
Does Tom have to be present?
Num Thomas adesse debet?
I'm eating dinner with my husband.
Cenam cum marito sumo.
Then trembling seized me and, amidst my fear, / what power I know not, but some power unkind / confused my wandering wits, and robbed me of my mind. / For while, the byways following, I left / the beaten track, ah! woe and well away! / my wife Creusa lost me – whether reft / by Fate, or faint or wandering astray, / I know not.
Hic mihi nescio quod trepido male numen amicum / confusam eripuit mentem: namque avia cursu / dum sequor et nota excedo regione viarum, / heu, misero conjux fatone erepta Creusa / subsistit, erravitne via, seu lassa resedit, / incertum.
Nor have seen her since that day, / nor sought, nor missed her, till in Ceres' fane / we met at length, and mustered our array. / There she alone was wanting of our train, / and husband, son and friends all looked for her in vain!
Nec post oculis est reddita nostris. / Nec prius amissam respexi animumve reflexi, / quam tumulum antiquæ Cereris sedemque sacratam / venimus: hic demum collectis omnibus una / defuit, et comites natumque virumque fefellit.

Whom then did I upbraid not, wild with woe, / of gods or men? What sadder sight elsewhere / had Troy, now whelmed in utter wreck, to show?
Quem non incusavi amens hominumque deorumque, / aut quid in eversa vidi crudelius urbe?
Did you open my chest?
Aperuistine arcam meam?

Tom died while writing.
Thomas scribens mortuus est.
Troy's gods commending to my comrades' care, / with old Anchises and my infant heir, / I hide them in a winding vale from view.
Ascanium Anchisenque patrem Teucrosque Penates / commendo sociis, et curva valle recondo.
Then, sheathed again in shining arms, prepare / once more to scour the city through and through, / resolved to brave all risks, all ventures to renew.
Ipse urbem repeto, et cingor fulgentibus armis. / Stat casus renovare omnes, omnemque reverti / per Trojam, et rursus caput objectare periclis.

This tree produces a lot of big fruit in spring.
Haec arbor vere multos magnosque fructus edit.
I reach the ramparts and the shadowy gates / whence first I issued, backward through the night / my studied steps retracing. Horror waits / around; the very silence breeds affright.
Principio muros obscuraque limina portæ, / qua gressum extuleram, repeto, et vestigia retro / observata sequor per noctem et lumine lustro: / horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent.
Keep the kids inside.
Serva liberos intus.
Then homeward turn, if haply in her flight, / if, haply, thither she had strayed; but ere / I came, behold, the Danaans, loud in fight, / swarmed through the halls.
Inde domum, si forte pedem, si forte, tulisset, / me refero: irruerant Danai et tectum omne tenebant.
Three of these are mine.
Tres illorum mei sunt.
Roof-high the fiery glare, / fanned by the wind, mounts up; the loud blast roars in air.
Ilicet ignis edax summa ad fastigia vento / volvitur; exsuperant flammæ, furit æstus ad auras.

Thomas est amicus optimus mariti mei.

Thomas opus mirabile fecit.
I'll try to change.
Tentabo mutari.
Again to Priam's palace, and again / up to the citadel I speed my way.
Procedo et Priami sedes arcemque reviso.
She was wearing a black hat.
Ea petasum nigrum gerebat.
Armed, in the vacant courts, by Juno's fane, / Phoenix and curst Ulysses watched the prey.
Et jam porticibus vacuis Junonis asylo / custodes lecti Phœnix et dirus Ulysses / prædam asservabant.
I'm going to do it.
Id faciam.
There, torn from many a burning temple, lay / Troy's wealth; the tripods of the Gods were there, / piled in huge heaps, and raiment snatched away, / and golden bowls, and dames with streaming hair / and tender boys stand round, and tremble with despair.
Huc undique Troia gaza / incensis erepta adytis, mensæque deorum, / crateresque auro solidi, captivaque vestis / congeritur; pueri et pavidæ longo ordine matres / stant circum.
Eat the fruit!
Fructum ēs!

Tom used to be scared of me.
Thomas me quondam timebat.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Me paenitet, te adiuvare non possum.
What's Tom asking?
Quid Thomas interrogat?
I shout, and through the darkness shout again, / rousing the streets, and call and call anew / "Creusa", and "Creusa", but in vain.
Ausus quin etiam voces jactare per umbram, / implevi clamore vias, mæstusque Creusam / nequidquam ingeminans iterumque iterumque vocavi.
From house to house in frenzy as I flew, / a melancholy spectre rose in view, / Creusa's very image; ay, 'twas there, / but larger than the living form I knew.
Quærenti et tectis urbis sine fine furenti, / infelix simulacrum atque ipsius umbra Creusæ / visa mihi ante oculos et nota major imago.
Aghast I stood, tongue-tied, with stiffening hair.
Obstupui, steteruntque comæ et vox faucibus hæsit.
Then she addressed me thus, and comforted my care. / "What boots this idle passion? Why so fain / sweet husband, thus to sorrow and repine?"
Tum sic affari et curas his demere dictis: / "Quid tantum insano juvat indulgere dolori, / o dulcis conjux?"
"Naught happens here but as the Gods ordain. / It may not be, nor doth the Lord divine / of high Olympus nor the Fates design / that thou should'st take Creusa."
"Non hæc sine numine divum / eveniunt; nec te comitem hinc portare Creusam / fas, aut ille sinit superi renator Olympi."
"Seas remain / to plough, long years of exile must be thine, / ere thou at length Hesperia's land shalt gain, / where Lydian Tiber glides through many a peopled plain."
"Longa tibi exsilia, et vastum maris æquor arandum; / et terram Hesperiam venies, ubi Lydius arva / inter opima virum leni fluit agmine Thybris."
She is beautiful and clever.
Ea pulchra et prudens est.
"Wide rule and happy days await thee there, / and royal marriage shall thy portion be. / Weep not for lov'd Creusa, weep not."
"Illic res lætæ regnumque et regia conjux / parta tibi: lacrimas dilectæ pelle Creusæ."
I'm the strongest.
Fortissimus sum.
"Ne'er / to Grecian women shall I bow the knee, / never in Argos see captivity, / I, who my lineage from the Dardans tell, / allied to Venus."
"Non ego Myrmidonum sedes Dolopumve superbas / adspiciam, aut Graiis servitum matribus ibo, / Dardanis et divæ Veneris nurus."
You're a good dancer.
Bene saltas.
"Now, by Fate's decree, / here with the mother of the Gods I dwell."
"Sed me magna deum Genetrix his detinet oris."
"Farewell, and guard in love our common child. Farewell!"
"Jamque vale, et nati serva communis amorem."
So spake she, and with weeping eyes I yearned / to answer, wondering at the words she said, / when lo, the shadowy spirit, as I turned, / dissolved in air, and in a moment fled.
Hæc ub dicta dedit, lacrimantem et multa volentem / dicere deseruit, tenuesque recessit in auras.
Thrice round the neck with longing I essayed / to clasp the phantom in a wild delight; / thrice, vainly clasped, the visionary shade / mocked me embracing, and was lost to sight, / swift as a winged wind or slumber of the night.
Ter conatus ibi collo dare brachia circum, / ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago, / par levibus ventis volucrique simillima somno.
Back to my friends I haste.
Sic demum socios, consumpta nocte, reviso.
There, behold, / matrons and men, a miserable band, / gathered for exile.
Atque hic ingentem comitum affluxisse novorum / invenio admirans numerum, matresque virosque, / collectam exsilio pubem, miserabile vulgus.
From each side they shoaled, / resolved and ready over sea and land / my steps to follow, where the Fates command.
Undique convenere animis opibusque parati, / in quascumque velim pelago deducere terras.
Now over Ida shone the day-star bright; / Greeks swarmed at every entrance; help at hand / seemed none. I yield, and, hurrying from the fight, / take up my helpless sire, and climb the mountain height.
Jamque jugis summæ surgebat Lucifer Idæ / ducebatque diem; Danaique obsessa tenebant / limina portarum, nec spes opis ulla dabatur. / Cessi et sublato montes genitore petivi.
You sent gifts from your country.
Dona e terra tua misisti.

Thomas et Maria liberi mei sunt.
When now the Gods have made proud Ilion fall, / and Asia's power and Priam's race renowned / o'erwhelmed in ruin undeserved, and all / Neptunian Troy lies smouldering on the ground, / in desert lands, to diverse exile bound, / celestial portents bid us forth to fare; / where Ida's heights above Antandros frowned, / a fleet we build, and gather crews, unware / which way the Fates will lead, what home is ours and where.
Postquam res Asiæ Priamique evertere gentem / immeritam visum superis, ceciditque superbum / Ilium et omnis humo fumat Neptunia Troja, / diversa exsilia et desertas quærere terras / auguriis agimur divum; classemque sub ipsa / Antandro et Phrygiæ molimur montibus Idæ, / incerti quo fata ferant, ubi sistere detur, / contrahimusque viros.
He hasn't read the book yet.
Nondum librum legit.
Scarce now the summer had begun, when straight / my father, old Anchises, gave command / to spread our canvas and to trust to Fate. / Weeping, I leave my native port, the land, / the fields where once the Trojan towers did stand, / and, homeless, launch upon the boundless brine, / heart-broken outcast, with an exiled band, / comrades, and son, and household gods divine, / and the great Gods of Troy, the guardians of our line.
Vix prima inceperat æstas, / et pater Anchises dare fatis vela jubebat; / litora cum patriæ lacrimans portusque relinquo / et campos, ubi Troja fuit. Feror exsul in altum / cum sociis natoque Penatibus et magnis dis.
Hide the money.
Occulta pecuniam!
I'm making a list.
Catalogum facio.
Tom will go.
Thomas ibit.
Those clocks got broken.
Illa horologia fracta sunt.
Far off there lies, with many a spacious plain, / the land of Mars, by Thracians tilled and sown, / where stern Lycurgus whilom held his reign; / a hospitable shore, to Troy well-known, / her home-gods leagued in union with our own, / while Fortune smiled.
Terra procul vastis colitur Mavortia campis, / Thraces arant, acri quondam regnata Lycurgo, / hospitium antiquum Trojæ, sociique Penates, / dum fortuna fuit.
Hither, with fates malign, / I steer, and landing for our purposed town / the walls along the winding shore design, / and coin for them a name "AEneadae" from mine.
Feror huc, et litore curvo / mœnia prima loco, fatis ingressus iniquis, / Aeneadas meo nomen de nomine fingo.
Did you buy this for them?
Emistine hoc pro eis?
That's why I'm here.
Pro illa causa adsum.
All people should love their country.
Omnibus amanda est patria.
The world still has not found peace.
Mundus nondum pacem invenit.
Due rites to Venus and the gods I bore, / the work to favour, and a sleek, white steer / to Heaven's high King was slaughtering on the shore.
Sacra Dionææ matri divisque ferebam / auspicibus cœptorum operum, superoque nitentem / cœlicolum regi mactabam in litore taurum.
My dog has a very long tail.
Canis meus caudam valde longam habet.
With cornel shrubs and many a prickly spear / of myrtle crowned, it chanced a mound was near.
Forte fuit juxta tumulus, quo cornea summo / virgulta et densis hastilibus horrida myrtus.
Thither I drew, and strove with eager hold / a green-leaved sapling from the soil to tear, / to shade with boughs the altars, when behold / a portent, weird to see and wondrous to unfold!
Accessi, viridemque ab humo convellere silvam / conatus, ramis tegerem ut frondentibus aras, / horrendum et dictu video mirabile monstrum.
Scarce the first stem uprooted, from the wood / black drops distilled, and stained the earth with gore.
Nam quæ prima solo ruptis radicibus arbos / vellitur, huic atro liquuntur sanguine guttæ, / et terram tabo maculant.
Can you catch a ball with one hand?

Thomas barbarus est.
We're not barbarians.

Barbarus non sum.
Cold horror shook me, in my veins the blood / was chilled, and curdled with affright.
Mihi frigidus horror / membra quatit, gelidusque coit formidine sanguis.
Once more / a limber sapling from the soil I tore; / once more, persisting, I resolved in mind / with inmost search the causes to explore / and probe the mystery that lurked behind; / dark drops of blood once more come trickling from the rind.
Rursus et alterius lentum convellere vimen / insequor, et causas penitus tentare latentes; / ater et alterius sequitur de cortice sanguis.
Much-musing, to the woodland nymphs I pray, / and Mars, the guardian of the Thracian plain, / with favouring grace the omen to allay, / and bless the dreadful vision.
Multa movens animo, Nymphas venerabar agrestes / Gradivumque patrem, Geticis qui præsidet arvis, / rite secundarent visus omenque levarent.
Then again / a third tall shaft I grasp, with sinewy strain / and firm knees pressed against the sandy ground; / when O! shall tongue make utterance or refrain? / forth from below a dismal, groaning sound / heaves, and a piteous voice is wafted from the mound:
Tertia sed postquam majore hastilia nisu / aggredior genibusque adversæ obluctor arenæ, / (eloquar an sileam?) gemitus lacrimabilis imo / auditur tumulo, et vox reddita fertur ad aures:
"Spare, O AEneas, spare a wretch, nor shame / thy guiltless hands, but let the dead repose. / From Troy, no alien to thy race, I came. / O, fly this greedy shore, these cruel foes! / Not from the tree – from Polydorus flows / this blood, for I am Polydorus. Here / an iron crop o'erwhelmed me, and uprose / bristling with pointed javelins."
"Quid miserum, Aenea, laceras? Jam parce sepulto, / parce pias scelerare manus: non me tibi Troja / externum tulit, aut cruor hic de stipite manat. / Heu fuge crudeles terras, fuge litus avarum: / nam Polydorus ego. Hic confixum ferrea texit / telorum seges et jaculis increvit acutis."
I feel so stupid.
Sentio me valde stultum esse.
I want what's best for him.
Volo quod optimum ei est.

Eis dicam te adesse.
Mute with fear, / perplext, aghast I stood, and upright rose my hair.
Tum vero ancipiti mentem formidine pressus / obstupui, steterumque comæ et vox faucibus hæsit.
This Polydorus Priam from the war / to Thracia's King in secret had consigned / with store of gold, when, girt with siege, he saw / Troy's towers, and trust in Dardan arms resigned.
Hunc Polydorum auri quondam cum pondere magno / infelix Priamus furtim mandarat alendum / Threicio regi, cum jam diffideret armis / Dardaniæ cingique urbem obsidione videret.
Are you working today?
Laborasne hodie?
Her sons are in the garden.
Filii eius in horto sunt.
But when our fortune and our hopes declined, / the treacherous King the conqueror's cause professed, / and, false to faith, to friendship and to kind, / slew Polydorus, and his wealth possessed. / Curst greed of gold, what crimes thy tyrant power attest!
Ille, ut opes fractæ Teucrum et Fortuna recessit, / res Agamemnonias victriciaque arma secutus, / fas omne abrumpit; Polydorum obtruncat et auro / vi potitur. Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, / auri sacra fames?
It has been raining since Tuesday.
De die Martis pluit.
That was the very beginning.
Fuit ipsum principium.
Monkeys are intelligent.
Simiae ingeniosae sunt.
Now, freed from terror, to my father first, / then to choice friends the vision I declare.
Postquam pavor ossa reliquit, / delectos populi ad proceres primumque parentem / monstra deum refero et, quæ sit sententia, posco.
All vote to sail, and quit the shore accurst.
Omnibus idem animus, scelerata excedere terra, / linqui pollutum hospitum et dare classibus austros.
So to his shade, with funeral rites, we rear / a mound, and altars to the dead prepare, / wreathed with dark cypress. Round them, as of yore, / pace Troy's sad matrons, with their streaming hair. / Warm milk from bowls, and holy blood we pour, / and thrice with loud farewell the peaceful shade deplore.
Ergo instauramus Polydoro funus, et ingens / aggeritur tumulo tellus; stant Manibus aræ / cæruleis mæstæ vittis atraque cupresso, / et circum Iliades crinem de more solutæ; / inferimus tepido spumantia cymbia lacte / sanguinis et sacri pateras, animamque sepulcro / condimus, et magna supremum voce ciemus.

Soon as our ships can trust the deep once more, / and South-winds chide, and Ocean smiles serene, / we crowd the beach, and launch, and town and shore / fade from our view.
Inde, ubi prima fides pelago, placataque venti / dant maria, et lenis crepitans vocat auster in altum, / deducunt socii naves et litora complent. / Provehimur portu, terræque urbesque recedunt.

Ea me monuit eo adire.
There, in a temple built of ancient stone / I worship: "Grant, Thymbrean lord divine, / a home, a settled city of our own, / walls to the weary, and a lasting line, / to Troy another Pergamus. Incline / and harken. Save these Dardans sore-distrest, / the remnant of Achilles' wrath. Some sign / vouchsafe us, whom to follow? where to rest? / Steal into Trojan hearts, and make thy power confessed."
Templa dei saxo venerabar structa vetusto: / "Da propriam, Thymbræe, domum! Da mœnia fessis / et genus et mansuram urbem! Serva altera Trojæ / Pergama, reliquias Danaum atque immitis Achilli. / Quem sequimur, quove ire jubes, ubi ponere sedes? / Da, pater, augurium, atque animis illabere nostris!"
Scarce spake I, suddenly the bays divine / shook, and a trembling seized the temple door. / The mountain heaves, and from the opening shrine / loud moans the tripod. Prostrate on the floor / we her a voice:
Vix ea fatus eram: tremere omnia visa repente, / liminaque laurusque dei, totusque moveri / mons circum, et mugire adytis cortina reclusis. / Submissi petimus terram, et vox fertur ad aures:
Honesty is praised and left in the cold.
Probitas laudatur, et alget.
"Brave hearts, the land that bore / your sires shall nurse their Dardan sons again. / Seek out your ancient mother; from her shore / through all the world the AEneian house shall reign, / and sons of sons unborn the lasting line sustain."
"Dardanidæ duri, quæ vos a stirpe parentum / prima tulit tellus, eadem vos ubere læto / accipiet reduces: antiquam exquirite matrem. / Hic domus Aeneæ cunctis dominabitur oris, / et nati natorum, et qui nascentur ab illis."

Then spake my sire, revolving in his mind / the ancient legends of the Trojan kind, / "Chieftains, give ear, and learn your hopes and mine."

"Nor yet proud Ilion nor her towers had stood; / in lowly vales sequestered they abode."
"Nondum Ilium et arces / Pergameæ steterant; habitabant vallibus imis."
"Thence Corybantian cymbals clashed and brayed / in praise of Cybele. In Ida's wood / her mystic rites in secrecy were paid, / and lions, yoked in pomp, their sovereign's car conveyed."
"Hinc mater cultrix Cybelæ, Corybantiaque aera, / Idæumque nemus; hinc fida silentia sacris, / et juncti currum dominæ subiere leones."
"Come then and seek we, as the gods command, / the Gnosian kingdoms, and the winds entreat. / Short is the way, nor distant lies the land. / If Jove be present and assist our fleet, / the third day lands us on the shores of Crete."
"Ergo agite et divum ducunt qua jussa sequamur; / placemus ventos et Gnosia regna petamus. / Nec longo distant cursu; modo Jupiter adsit, / tertia lux classem Cretæis sistet in oris."
This shows his loyalty to his friends.

So spake he and on altars, reared aright, / due victims offered, and libations meet; / a bull to Neptune and Apollo bright, / to tempest a black lamb, to Western winds a white.
Sic fatus, meritos aris mactavit honores, / taurum Neptuno, taurum tibi, pulcher Apollo, / nigram Hiemi pecudem, Zephyris felicibus albam.
Fame flies, Idomeneus has left the land, / expelled his kingdom; that the shore lies clear / of foes, and homes are ready to our hand.
Fama volat pulsum regnis cessisse paternis / Idomenea ducem, desertaque litora Cretæ, / hoste vacare domos, sedesque adstare relictas.
Ortygia's port we leave, and skim the mere; / soon Naxos' Bacchanalian hills appear, / and past Olearos and Donysa, crowned / with trees, and Paros' snowy cliffs we steer. / Far-scattered shine the Cyclades renowned, / and clustering isles thick-sown in many a glittering sound.
Linquimus Ortygiæ portus, pelagoque volamus; / Bacchatamque jugis Naxon, viridemque Donysam, / Olearon, niveamque Paron, sparsasque per æquor / Cycladas et crebris legimus freta concita terris.

Loud rise the shouts of sailors to the sky; / "Crete and our fathers", rings for all to hear / the cry of oarsmen.
Nauticus exoritur vario certamine clamor, / hortantur socii: "Cretam proavosque petamus!"
Through the deep we fly; / behind us sings the stern breeze loud and clear. / So to the shores of ancient Crete we steer.
Prosequitur surgens a puppi ventus euntes, / et tandem antiquis Curetum allabimur oris.
There in glad haste I trace the wished-for town, / and call the walls "Pergamea", and cheer / my comrades, glorying in the name well-known, / the castled keep to raise, and guard the loved hearth-stone.
Ergo avidus muros optatæ molior urbis, / Pergameamque voco, et lætam cognomine gentem / hortor amare focos arcemque attollere tectis.
Scarce stand the vessels hauled upon the beach, / and bent on marriages the young men vie / to till new settlements, while I to each / due law dispense and dwelling place supply, / when from a tainted quarter of the sky / rank vapours, gathering, on my comrades seize, / and a foul pestilence creeps down from high / on mortal limbs and standing crops and trees, / a season black with death, and pregnant with disease.
Jamque fere sicco subductæ litore puppes, / connubiis arvisque novis operata juventus; / jura domosque dabam: subito cum tabida membris, / corrupto cœli tractu, miserandaque venit / arboribusque satisque lues et letifer annus.

Once more Anchises bids us cross the main / and seek Ortygia, and the god constrain / by prayer to pardon and advise, what end / of evils to expect? what woes remain? / What fate hereafter shall our steps attend? / What rest for toil-worn men, and whitherward to wend?
Rursus ad oraclum Ortygiæ Phœbumque remenso / hortatur pater ire mari, veniamque precari, / quam fessis finem rebus ferat, unde laborum / tentare auxilium jubeat, quo vertere cursus.

Talibus attonitus visis ac voce deorum / (nec sopor illud erat, sed coram agnoscere vultus / velatasque comas præsentiaque ora videbar, / tum gelidus toto manabat corpore sudor), / corripio e stratis corpus, tendoque supinas / ad cœlum cum voce manus, et munera libo / intemerata focis. Perfecto lætus honore / Anchisen facio certum, remque ordine pando.

The fleet was on mid ocean; land no more / was visible, naught else above, before / but sky and sea, when overhead did loom / a storm-cloud, black as heaven itself, that bore / dark night and wintry tempest in its womb, / and all the waves grew rough and shuddered with the gloom.
Postquam altum tenuere rates, nec jam amplius ullæ / apparent terræ, cœlum undique et undique pontus, / tum mihi cæruleus supra caput adstitit imber / noctem hiememque ferens, et inhorruit unda tenebris.
Winds roll the waters, and the great seas rise. / Dispersed we welter on the gulfs. Damp night / has snatched with rain the heaven from our eyes, / and storm-mists in a mantle wrapt the light. / Flash after flash, and for a moment bright, / quick lightnings rend the welkin. Driven astray / we wander, robbed of reckoning, reft of sight. / No difference now between the night and day / e'en Palinurus sees, nor recollects the way.
Continuo venti volvunt mare magnaque surgunt / æquora: dispersi jactamur gurgite vasto. / Involvere diem nimbi, et nox humida cœlum / abstulit; ingeminant abruptis nubibus ignes. / Excutimur cursu, et cæcis erramus in undis. / Ipse diem noctemque negat discernere cœlo, / nec meminisse viæ media Palinurus in unda.
She buried a dog.
Ea canem sepelivit.
Three days, made doubtful by the blinding gloom, / as many nights, when not a star is seen, / we wander on, uncertain of our doom.

At last the fourth glad daybreak clears the scene, / and rising land, and opening uplands green, / and rolling smoke at distance greet the view.
Quarto terra die primum se attollere tandem / visa, aperire procul montes ac volvere fumum.
No longer tarrying; to our oars we lean. / Down drop the sails; in order ranged, each crew / flings up the foam to heaven, and sweeps the sparkling blue.

Fire glows, burns and consumes to ashes. A spark of it struck from a flint (or firestone) by means of a steel, and taken by tinder in a tinder box, lights a match, and after that a candle, or a stick, and causes a flame, or blaze, which catches hold of houses.

"There rest they, nor their sequence change, nor place, / save when, by chance, on grating hinge the door / swings open, and a light breath sweeps the floor, / or rougher blasts the tender leaves disperse. / Loose then they flutter, for she recks no more / to call them back, and rearrange the verse; / untaught the votaries leave, the Sibyl's cave to curse."
"Illa manent immota locis, neque ab ordine cedunt. / Verum eadem, verso tenuis cum cardine ventus / impulit et teneras turbavit janua frondes, / nunquam deinde cavo volitantia prendere saxo, / nec revocare situs aut jungere carmina curat: / inconsulti abeunt, sedemque odere Sibyllæ."

Quæ postquam vates sic ore effatus amico est, / dona dehinc auro gravia sectoque elephanto / imperat ad naves ferri, stipatque carinis / ingens argentum Dodonæosque lebetas, / loricam consertam hamis auroque trilicem, / et conum insignis galeæ cristasque comantes, / arma Neoptolemi.

Then to Anchises, as he bids us spread / the sails, with reverence speaks Apollo's seer, / "Far-famed Anchises, honoured with the bed / of haughty Venus, Heaven's peculiar care, / Twice saved from Troy! behold Ausonia there, / steer towards her coasts, yet skirt them; far away / that region lies, which Phoebus doth prepare. / Blest in thy son's devotion, take thy way. / Why should more words of mine the rising South delay?"
Interea classem velis aptare jubebat / Anchises, fieret vento mora ne qua ferenti. / Quem Phœbi interpres multo compellat honore: / "Conjugio Anchisa Veneris dignate superbo, / cura deum, bis Pergameis erepte ruinis, / ecce tibi Ausoniæ tellus: hanc arripe velis. / Et tamen hanc pelago præterlabare necesse est. / Ausoniæ pars illa procul, quam pandit Apollo. / Vade, ait, o felix nati pietate! Quid ultra / provehor, et fando surgentes demoror austros?"
Nor less Andromache, sore grieved to part, / rich raiment fetches, wrought with golden thread, / and Phrygian scarf, and still with bounteous heart / loads him with broideries. "Take these", she said, / "sole image of Astyanax now dead. / Thy kin's last gifts, my handiwork, to show / how Hector's widow loved the son she bred. / Such eyes had he, such very looks as thou, / such hands, and oh! like thine his age were ripening now!"
Nec minus Andromache, digressu mæsta supremo, / fert picturatas auri subtemine vestes / et Phrygiam Ascanio chlamydem, nec cedit honori, / textilibusque onerat donis, ac talia fatur: / "Accipe et hæc, manuum tibi quæ monumenta mearum / sint, puer, et longum Andromachae testentur amorem, / conjugis Hectoræ; cape dona extrema tuorum, / o mihi sola mei super Astyanactis imago. / Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat, / et nunc æquali tecum pubesceret ævo."
With gushing tears I bid the pair farewell. / "Live happy ye, whose destinies are o'er; / we still must wander where the Fates compel."
Hos ego digrediens lacrimis affabar obortis: / "Vivite felices, quibus est fortuna peracta / jam sua! Nos alia ex aliis in fata vocamur."

Nor yet had Night climbed heaven, when up from sleep / starts Palinurus, and with listening ear / catches the breeze. He marks the stars, that keep / their courses, gliding through the silent sphere, / Arcturus, rainy Hyads and each Bear, / and, girt with gold, Orion.
Necdum orbem medium nox horis acta subibat: / haud segnis strato surgit Palinurus, et omnes / explorat ventos, atque auribus aéra captat; / sidera cuncta notat tacito labentia cœlo, / Arcturum pluviasque Hyadas geminosque Triones, / armatumque auro circumspicit Oriona.
Far away / he sees the firmament all calm and clear, / and from the stern gives signal. We obey, / and shifting camp, set sail and tempt the doubtful way.
Postquam cuncta videt cœlo constare sereno, / dat clarum e puppi signum; nos castra movemus, / tentamusque viam et velorum pandimus alas.

Then sire Anchises hastened to entwine / a massive goblet with a wreath, and vowed / libations to the gods, and poured the wine / and on the lofty stern invoked the powers divine: / "Great gods, whom Earth and Sea and Storms obey, / breathe fair, and waft us smoothly o'er the main."
Tum pater Anchises magnum cratera corona / induit implevitque mero, divosque vocavit / stans celsa in puppi: / "Di, maris et terræ tempestatumque potentes, / ferte viam vento facilem, et spirate secundi."

And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven; and let us make our name famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands.
Et dixerunt: Venite, faciamus nobis civitatem et turrim, cuius culmen pertingat ad cælum, et celebremus nomen nostrum, ne dividamur super faciem universæ terræ.
And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of Adam were building.
Descendit autem Dominus, ut videret civitatem et turrim, quam ædificaverunt filii hominum.
And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all have one tongue: and they have begun to do this, neither will they leave off from their designs till they accomplish them in deed.
Et dixit Dominus: Ecce unus est populus et unum labium omnibus; et hoc est initium operationis eorum, nec eis erit deinceps difficile, quidquid cogitaverint facere.
Come ye, therefore, let us go down and there confound their tongue, that they may not understand one another's speech.
Venite igitur, descendamus et confundamus ibi linguam eorum, ut non intellegat unusquisque vocem proximi sui.
And so the Lord scattered them from that place into all lands, and they ceased to build the city.
Atque ita divisit eos Dominus ex illo loco super faciem universæ terræ, et cessaverunt ædificare civitatem.
And therefore the name thereof was called Babel, because there the language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.

And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and out of thy father's house, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy five years old when he went forth from Haran.

Abram passed through the country unto the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Canaanite was at that time in the land.

And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for me, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son; and therefore she called his name Dan.
Dixitque Rachel: “Iudicavit mihi Deus et exaudivit vocem quoque meam dans mihi filium”; et idcirco appellavit nomen illius Dan.
And again Bala conceived, and bore another, for whom Rachel said: God hath compared me with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called him Nephthali.
Rursumque Bilha famula Rachel concepit et peperit Iacob alterum filium, et ait Rachel: "Certamina Dei certavi cum sorore mea et invalui”; vocavitque eum Nephthali.
Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing, gave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband. And when she had conceived, and brought forth a son, she said: Happily. And therefore called his name Gad.
Sentiens Lia quod parere desisset, sumpsit Zelpham ancillam suam et tradidit eam Iacob in uxorem. Quæ peperit Iacob filium. Dixitque Lia: “Feliciter!”; et idcirco vocavit nomen eius Gad.
Zelpha also bore another.
Peperit quoque Zelpha ancilla Liæ Iacob alterum filium.
And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for women will call me blessed. Therefore she called him Aser.
Dixitque Lia: “Pro beatitudine mea! Beatam quippe me dicent mulieres”; propterea appellavit eum Aser.
And Ruben going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the field, found mandrakes, which he brought to his mother Lia. And Rachel said: Give me part of thy son's mandrakes.
Egressus autem Ruben tempore messis triticeæ, repperit in agro mandragoras, quas Liæ matri suæ detulit. Dixitque Rachel: Da mihi partem de mandragoris filii tui.
She answered: Dost thou think it a small matter, that thou hast taken my husband from me, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes? Rachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night, for thy son's mandrakes.
Illa respondit: “Parumne tibi videtur, quod præripueris maritum mihi, ut etiam mandragoras filii mei auferas?” Ait Rachel: “Dormiat ergo tecum hac nocte pro mandragoris filii tui”.
And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman, and that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife, and they will kill me and keep thee.
Cumque prope esset, ut ingrederetur Aegyptum, dixit Sarai uxori suæ: Novi quod pulchra sis mulier et quod, cum viderint te Aegyptii, dicturi sunt: "Uxor ipsius est"; et interficient me et te reservabunt.
Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister, that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.
Dic ergo, obsecro te, quod soror mea sis, ut bene sit mihi propter te, et vivat anima mea ob gratiam tui.
And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.
Cum itaque ingressus esset Abram Aegyptum, viderunt Aegyptii mulierem quod esset pulchra nimis.
And the princes told Pharaoh, and praised her before him, and the woman was taken into the house of Pharaoh.
Et viderunt eam principes pharaonis et laudaverunt eam apud illum; et sublata est mulier in domum pharaonis.
And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen and he-asses, and men servants, and maid servants, and she-asses, and camels.
Abram vero bene usus est propter illam; fueruntque ei oves et boves et asini et servi et famulæ et asinæ et cameli.
But the Lord scourged Pharaoh and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram's wife.
Flagellavit autem Dominus pharaonem plagis maximis et domum eius propter Sarai uxorem Abram.
And Pharaoh called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
Vocavitque pharao Abram et dixit ei: Quidnam est hoc quod fecisti mihi? Quare non indicasti mihi quod uxor tua esset?
For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
Quam ob causam dixisti esse sororem tuam, ut tollerem eam mihi in uxorem? Nunc igitur, ecce coniux tua: accipe eam, et vade!
And Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning Abram, and they led him away and his wife, and all that he had.
Præcepitque pharao super Abram viris; et deduxerunt eum et uxorem illius et omnia, quæ habebat.
And when Jacob returned at even from the field, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou shalt come in unto me because I have hired thee for my son's mandrakes. And he slept with her that night.
Redeuntique ad vesperam Iacob de agro egressa est in occursum eius Lia et: “Ad me, inquit, intrabis, quia mercede conduxi te pro mandragoris filii mei”. Dormivitque cum ea nocte illa.
And God heard her prayers; and she conceived: and bore a fifth son. And said: God hath given me a reward, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar.
Et exaudivit Deus Liam, concepitque et peperit Iacob filium quintum et ait: “Dedit Deus mercedem mihi, quia dedi ancillam meam viro meo”; appellavitque nomen illius Issachar.
And Lia conceived again, and bore the sixth son. And said: God hath endowed me with a good dowry; this turn also my husband will be with me, because I have borne him six sons: and therefore she called his name Zabulon.
Rursum Lia concepit et peperit Iacob sextum filium et ait: “Donavit me Deus dono bono; hac vice honorabit me maritus meus, eo quod genuerim ei sex filios”; et idcirco appellavit nomen eius Zabulon.
After whom she bore a daughter, named Dina.
Post quem peperit filiam nomine Dinam.
The Lord, also remembering Rachel, heard her and opened her womb.
Recordatus quoque Deus Rachelis exaudivit eam Deus et aperuit vulvam illius.
And she conceived, and bore a son, saying: God hath taken away my reproach. And she called his name Joseph, saying: The Lord give me also another son.
Quæ concepit et peperit filium dicens: “Abstulit Deus opprobrium meum”; et vocavit nomen illius Ioseph dicens: “Addat mihi Dominus filium alterum!”
And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to his father-in-law: Send me away, that I may return into my country, and to my land.
Nato autem Ioseph, dixit Iacob ad Laban: Dimitte me, ut revertar in patriam et ad terram meam.
Give me my wives, and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may depart: thou knowest the service that I have rendered thee.
Da mihi uxores et liberos meos, pro quibus servivi tibi, ut abeam; tu nosti servitutem, qua servivi tibi.
Laban said to him: Let me find favour in thy sight. I have learned, by experience, that God hath blessed me for thy sake.
Ait illi Laban: Inveniam gratiam in conspectu tuo; augurio didici, quia benedixerit mihi Deus propter te.
Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.
Constitue mercedem tuam, quam dem tibi.
But he answered: Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how great thy possession hath been in my hands.
At ille respondit: Tu nosti quomodo servierim tibi et quanti in manibus meis facti sint greges tui.
Thou hadst but little before I came to thee, and now thou art become rich, and the Lord hath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable, therefore, that I should now provide also for my oun house.
Modicum habuisti, antequam venirem ad te, et nunc multiplicatum est vehementer, benedixitque tibi Dominus ad introitum meum. Nunc autem quando providebo etiam domui meæ?
And Laban said: What shall I give thee? But he said: I require nothing, but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep again.
Dixitque Laban: “Quid tibi dabo?” At ille ait: “Nihil mihi dabis; si feceris, quod postulo, iterum pascam et custodiam pecora tua".
Go round through all thy flocks, and separate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled; and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall be my wages.
Gyrabo omnes greges tuos hodie; separa cuncta pecora varia et maculosa et, quodcumque furvum in ovibus et maculosum variumque in capris fuerit, erit merces mea.
And my justice shall answer for me tomorrow before thee, when the time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall accuse me of theft.
Respondebitque mihi cras iustitia mea; quando veneris, ut inspicias mercedem meam, omnia, quæ non fuerint varia et maculosa in capris et furva in ovibus, furti me arguent.
And Laban said: I like well what thou demandest.
Dixit Laban: Gratum habeo, quod petis!
And he separated the same day the she-goats, and the sheep, and the he-goats, and the rams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and black fleece, he delivered into the hands of his sons.
Et separavit in die illo hircos striatos atque maculosos et omnes capras varias et maculosas, omne, in quo album erat, et omne furvum in ovibus, et tradidit in manu filiorum suorum.
And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and his son-in-law, who fed the rest of his flock.
Et posuit spatium itineris trium dierum inter se et Iacob, qui pascebat reliquos greges Laban.
And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and of almond, and of plane-trees, and pilled them in part; so when the bark was taken off, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness; but the parts that were whole remained green; and by this means the colour was divers.
Tollens ergo Iacob virgas virides populeas et amygdalinas et ex platanis, ex parte ita decorticavit eas, ut in his, quæ spoliata fuerant, candor appareret.
And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out; that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them might conceive.
Posuitque virgas, quas ex parte decorticaverat, in canalibus, ubi effundebatur aqua, ut, cum venissent greges ad bibendum, ante oculos haberent virgas et in aspectu earum conciperent.
And it came to pass, that in the very heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of divers coulours, and speckled.
Factumque est ut in ipso calore coitus greges intuerentur virgas et parerent striata et varia et maculosa.
And Jacob separated the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams; and all the white and the black were Laban's, and the rest were Jacob's, when the flocks were separated one from the other.
Agnos autem segregavit Iacob et posuit gregem ex adverso striatorum et omnium furvorum in grege Laban et constituit sibi greges seorsum neque statuit eos cum grege Laban.
So when the ewes went first to ram, Jacob put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon them.
Quotiescumque igitur calefiebant pecora robusta, ponebat Iacob virgas in canalibus aquarum ante oculos pecorum, ut in earum contemplatione conciperent.
But when the later coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were lateward became laban's; and they of the first time Jacob's. And the man was enriched exceedingly, and he had many flocks, maid-servants and men-servants, camels and asses.
Quando vero pecora debilia erant, non ponebat eas. Factaque sunt debilia Laban et robusta Iacob; ditatusque est homo ultra modum et habuit greges multos, ancillas et servos, camelos et asinos.
And Abram went up out of Egypt he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him into the south.
Ascendit ergo Abram de Aegypto ipse et uxor eius et omnia, quæ habebat, et Lot cum eo ad Nageb.
And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.
Abram autem erat dives valde in pecoribus, argento et auro.
And he returned by the way that he came from the south to Bethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and Hai, in the place of the altar which he had made before, and there he called upon the name of the Lord.
Et profectus est de mansione in mansionem a Nageb in Bethel usque ad locum, ubi prius fixerat tabernaculum inter Bethel et Hai, in loco altaris, quod fecerat prius, et invocavit ibi nomen Domini.
But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.
Sed et Lot, qui erat cum Abram, fuerunt greges ovium et armenta et tabernacula.
Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, and they could not dwell together.
Nec poterat eos capere terra, ut habitarent simul: erat quippe substantia eorum multa, et nequibant habitare communiter.
Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot. And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.
Unde et facta est rixa inter pastores gregum Abram et pastores gregum Lot. Eo autem tempore Chananæus et Pherezæus habitabant in terra illa.
Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.
Dixit ergo Abram ad Lot: Ne, quæso, sit iurgium inter me et te et inter pastores meos et pastores tuos: fratres enim sumus.
Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me, I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right: if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the left.
Nonne universa terra coram te est? Recede a me, obsecro: si ad sinistram ieris, ego dexteram tenebo; si tu dexteram elegeris, ego ad sinistram pergam.
And Lot lifting up his eyes saw all the country about the Jordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes to Segor.
Elevatis itaque Lot oculis, vidit omnem circa regionem Iordanis, quæ universa irrigabatur, antequam subverteret Dominus Sodomam et Gomorram, sicut paradisus Domini et sicut Aegyptus usque in Segor.
And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he departed from the east: and they were separated one brother from the other.
Elegitque sibi Lot regionem circa Iordanem et recessit ab oriente; divisique sunt alterutrum a fratre suo.
Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot abode in the towns that were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.
Abram habitavit in terra Chanaan; Lot vero moratus est in oppidis, quæ erant circa Iordanem, et tabernacula movit usque ad Sodomam.
And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the face of the Lord beyond measure.
Homines autem Sodomitæ pessimi erant et pecatores coram Domino nimis.
And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west.
Dixitque Dominus ad Abram, postquam divisus est Lot ab eo: Leva oculos tuos et vide a loco, in quo nunc es, ad aquilonem et meridiem, ad orientem et occidentem.
All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy seed for ever.
Omnem terram, quam conspicis, tibi dabo et semini tuo usque in sempiternum.
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any man be able to number the dust of the earth, he shall be able to number thy seed also.
Faciamque semen tuum sicut pulverem terræ: si quis potest hominum numerare pulverem terræ, semen quoque tuum numerare poterit.
Arise and walk through the land in the length, and in the breadth thereof: for I will give it to thee.
Surge et perambula terram in longitudine et in latitudine sua, quia tibi daturus sum eam.
So Abram removing his tent came and dwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron: and he built there an altar to the Lord.
Movens igitur tabernaculum suum, Abram venit et habitavit iuxta Quercus Mambre, quæ sunt in Hebron, ædificavitque ibi altare Domino.
But after that he had heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's, and being enriched by his substance is become great. And perceiving also, that Laban's countenance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day.
Postquam autem audivit verba filiorum Laban dicentium: “Tulit Iacob omnia, quæ fuerunt patris nostri, et de patris nostri facultate acquisivit has divitias”, animadvertit quoque faciem Laban quod non esset erga se sicut heri et nudiustertius.
Especially the Lord saying to him: Return into the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.
Et dixit Dominus ad Iacob: Revertere in terram patrum tuorum et ad cognationem tuam, eroque tecum.
He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the field, where he fed the flocks, and said to them: I see your father's countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day: but the God of my father hath been with me. And you know that I have served your father to the uttermost of my power.
Misit Iacob et vocavit Rachel et Liam in agrum, ubi pascebat greges, dixitque eis: Video faciem patris vestri quod non sit erga me sicut heri et nudiustertius; Deus autem patris mei fuit mecum, et ipsæ nostis quod totis viribus meis servierim patri vestro.
Yea your father hath also overreached me, and hath changed my wages ten times: and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me.
Sed pater vester circumvenit me et mutavit mercedem meam decem vicibus; et tamen non dimisit eum Deus, ut noceret mihi.
If at any time he said: The speckled shall be thy wages, all the sheep brought forth speckled; but when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt take all the white one for thy wages, all the flocks brought forth white ones.
Si quando dixit: "Variæ erunt mercedes tuæ", pariebant omnes oves varios fetus. Quando vero e contrario ait: "Striata quæque accipies pro mercede", omnes greges striata pepererunt.
And God hath taken your father's substance, and given it to me.
Tulitque Deus substantiam patris vestri et dedit mihi.
For after the time came of the ewes conceiving, I lifted up my eyes and saw in my sleep that the males which leaped upon the females were of divers colours, and spotted, and speckled.
Postquam enim conceptus gregis tempus advenerat, levavi oculos meos et vidi in somnis ascendentes mares super feminas, striatos et varios et respersos.
And the angel of God said to me in my sleep: Jacob. And I answered: Here I am. And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the males leaping upon the females are of divers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee.
Dixitque angelus Dei ad me in somnis: "Iacob". Et ego respondi: "Adsum". Qui ait: "Leva oculos tuos et vide universos masculos ascendentes super feminas, striatos et varios atque respersos. Vidi enim omnia, quæ fecit tibi Laban".
I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and return into thy native country.
Ego sum Deus Bethel, ubi unxisti lapidem et votum vovisti mihi. Nunc ergo surge et egredere de terra hac revertens in terram nativitatis tuæ.
Hath he not counted us as strangers, and sold us, and eaten up the price of us?
Nonne quasi alienas reputavit nos et vendidit nos comeditque pretium nostrum?
But God hath taken our father's riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children: wherefore, do all that God hath commanded thee.
Sed omnes opes, quas tulit Deus patri nostro, nobis abstulit ac filiis nostris; unde omnia, quæ præcepit tibi Deus, fac.
Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way.
Surrexit itaque Iacob et imposuit liberos suos ac coniuges suas super camelos.
And he took all his substance, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land of Canaan.
Tulitque omnes greges suos et omnem substantiam suam, quidquid in Paddanaram acquisierat, ut iret ad Isaac patrem suum in terram Chanaan.
At that time Laban was gone to sheer his sheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols.
Eo tempore Laban ierat ad tondendas oves, et Rachel furata est theraphim patris sui.
And Jacob would not confess to his father-in-law that he was flying away.
Iacob autem decepit cor Laban, non indicans ei quod fugeret.
And when he was gone, together with all that belonged to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount Galaad, it was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob fled.
Cumque fugisset cum omnibus, quæ possidebat, et, amne transmisso, pergeret contra montem Galaad, nuntiatum est Laban die tertio quod fugisset Iacob.
And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad.
Qui, assumptis fratribus suis, persecutus est eum diebus septem et comprehendit eum in monte Galaad.
And he saw in a dream God, saying to him: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.
Venit autem Deus ad Laban Aramæum per somnium noctis dixitque ei: Cave, ne quidquam loquaris contra Iacob!
Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain; and when he, with his brethren, had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad.
Iamque Iacob extenderat in monte tabernaculum, cum Laban, consecutus eum cum fratribus suis, in eodem monte Galaad fixit tentorium.
And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters as captives taken with the sword?
Et dixit ad Iacob: Quare ita egisti et decepisti cor meum, abigens filias meas quasi captivas gladio?
Why wouldst thou run away privately, and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?
Cur clam fugisti et decepisti me, non indicans mihi, ut prosequerer te cum gaudio et canticis et tympanis et citharis?
Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and now indeed it is in my power to return thee evil; but the God of your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.
Non es passus, ut oscularer filios meos ac filias; stulte operatus es. Et nunc valet quidem manus mea reddere tibi malum, sed Deus patris vestri heri dixit mihi: Cave, ne loquaris contra Iacob quidquam!
Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing after thy father's house: why hast thou stolen away my gods?
Esto, profectus es, quia desiderio tibi erat domus patris tui; cur furatus es deos meos?
Jacob answered: That I departed unknown to thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force.
Respondit Iacob: Quia timui. Dixi enim, ne forte violenter auferres filias tuas a me.
But, whereas thou chargest me with theft, with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away. Now when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols.
Apud quemcumque inveneris deos tuos, non vivat! Coram fratribus nostris scrutare, quidquid tuorum apud me inveneris, et aufer. Ignorabat enim Iacob quod Rachel furata esset theraphim.
So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not. An when he was entered into Rachel's tent, she, in haste, hid the idols under the camel's furniture, and sat upon them.
Ingressus itaque Laban tabernacula Iacob et Liæ et utriusque famulæ, non invenit. Egressus de tentorio Liæ, intravit tentorium Rachelis. Illa autem absconderat theraphim in stramento cameli et sedit desuper.
And when he had searched all the tent, and founding nothing, she said: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me according to the custom of women. So his careful search was in vain.
Scrutantique omne tentorium et nihil invenienti ait: “Ne irascatur dominus meus, quod coram te assurgere nequeo, quia iuxta consuetudinem feminarum nunc accidit mihi”. Quæsivit ergo et non invenit theraphim.
And Jacob being angry said in a chiding manner: For what fault of mine, and for what offence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me, and searched all my household stuff? What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee.
Tumensque Iacob cum iurgio ait: Quam ob culpam meam et ob quod peccatum meum sic persecutus es me, quia scrutatus es omnem supellectilem meam? Quid invenisti de cuncta substantia domus tuæ? Pone hic coram fratribus meis et fratribus tuis, et iudicent inter me et te.
Have I therefore been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat; neither did I shew thee that which the beast had torn; I made good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it of me.
Ecce, viginti annis fui tecum. Oves tuæ et capræ non abortiverunt, arietes gregis tui non comedi; nec dilaceratum a bestia ostendi tibi: ego damnum omne reddebam; quidquid die noctuque furto perierat, a me exigebas.
Day and night was I parched with heat, and with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.
Die æstu consumebar et nocte gelu, fugiebatque somnus ab oculis meis.
And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times.
Sic per viginti annos in domo tua servivi tibi: quattuordecim pro filiabus et sex pro gregibus tuis; immutasti quoque mercedem meam decem vicibus.
Unless the God of my father, Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.
Nisi Deus patris mei, Deus Abraham et Timor Isaac, affuisset mihi, certemodo nudum me dimisisses; afflictionem meam et laborem manuum mearum respexit Deus et iudicavit heri.
Laban answered him: The daughters are mine, and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine: what can I do to my children, and grandchildren?
Respondit ei Laban: Filiæ filiæ meæ et filii filii mei et greges greges mei et omnia, quæ cernis, mea sunt; et filiabus meis quid possum facere illis hodie et filiis earum, quos genuerunt?
Come, therefore, let us enter into a league; that it may be for a testimony between me and thee.
Veni ergo, et ineamus fœdus ego et tu, ut sit in testimonium inter me et te.
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title. And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And they, gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it.
Tulit itaque Iacob lapidem et erexit illum in titulum; dixitque fratribus suis: “Afferte lapides”. Qui congregantes fecerunt tumulum comederuntque ibi super eum.
And Laban called it 'The witness heap'; and Jacob, 'The hillock of testimony': each of them according to the propriety of his language.
Quem vocavit Laban Iegarsahadutha (id est Tumulus testimonii), et Iacob Galed (uterque iuxta proprietatem linguæ suæ).
And Laban said: This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day, and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The witness heap. The Lord behold and judge between us, when we shall be gone one from the other.
Dixitque Laban: “Tumulus iste testis erit inter me et te hodie”; et idcirco appellatum est nomen eius Galed (id est Tumulus testis) et etiam Maspha (id est Specula), quia dixit: “Speculetur Dominus inter me et te, quando absconditi erimus ab invicem".
If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but God, who is present and beholdeth.
Si afflixeris filias meas et si introduxeris uxores alias super eas, cum nemo nobiscum sit, vide, Deus est testis inter me et te.
And he said again to Jacob: Behold this heap, and the stone which I have set up between me and thee, shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.
Dixitque Laban ad Iacob: En tumulus hic et lapis, quem erexi inter me et te. Testis erit tumulus iste et lapis quod ego non transibo tumulum hunc pergens ad te, neque tu transibis tumulum hunc et lapidem hunc ad malum.
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac. And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten, they lodged there.
Deus Abraham et Deus Nachor iudicent inter nos. Iuravit Iacob per Timorem patris sui Isaac; immolatisque victimis in monte, vocavit fratres suos, ut ederent panem. Qui cum comedissent, pernoctaverunt in monte.
But Laban arose in the night, and kissed his sons and daughters, and blessed them: and returned to his place.
Laban vero de nocte consurgens osculatus est filios et filias suas et benedixit illis reversusque est in locum suum.
Iacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him.
Iacob quoque abiit itinere, quo cœperat, fueruntque ei obviam angeli Dei.
And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.
Quos cum vidisset, ait: "Castra Dei sunt hæc”; et appellavit nomen loci illius Mahanaim (id est Castra).
And he sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom.
Misit autem nuntios ante se ad Esau fratrem suum in terram Seir, in regionem Edom.
And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day. I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.
Præcepitque eis dicens: Sic loquimini domino meo Esau: "Hæc dicit servus tuus Iacob: 'Apud Laban peregrinatus sum et fui usque in præesentem diem. Habeo boves et asinos, oves et servos atque ancillas; mittoque nunc legationem ad dominum meum, ut inveniam gratiam in conspectu tuo'".
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.
Reversique sunt nuntii ad Iacob dicentes: Venimus ad Esau fratrem tuum, et ecce properat in occursum tibi cum quadringentis viris.
Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies, saying: If Esau come to one company, and destroy it, the other company that is left shall escape.
Timuit Iacob valde et perterritus divisit populum, qui secum erat, greges quoque et oves et boves et camelos in duas turmas dicens: Si venerit Esau ad unam turmam et percusserit eam, alia turma, quæ reliqua est, salvabitur.
And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee, I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant.
Dixitque Iacob: Deus patris mei Abraham et Deus patris mei Isaac, Domine, qui dixisti mihi: "Revertere in terram tuam et in locum nativitatis tuæ, et benefaciam tibi", minor sum cunctis miserationibus et cuncta veritate, quam explesti servo tuo.
With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies. Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps he come and kill the mother with the children.
In baculo meo transivi Iordanem istum et nunc cum duabus turmis regredior. Erue me de manu fratris mei, de manu Esau, quia valde eum timeo; ne forte veniens percutiat matrem cum filiis.
Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
Tu locutus es quod bene mihi faceres et dilatares semen meum sicut arenam maris, quæ præ multitudine numerari non potest.
And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau: two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she-asses, and ten of their foals.
Mansit ibi nocte illa et sumpsit de his, quæ habebat, munera Esau fratri suo: capras ducentas, hircos viginti, oves ducentas et arietes viginti, camelos fetas cum pullis suis triginta, vaccas quadraginta et tauros decem, asinas viginti et pullos earum decem.
What do you have in your hand?
Quid in manu habes?
His father was a policeman.
Pater eius vigil publicus erat.
That is almost correct.
Fere recte dicitur.
And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.
Et misit per manus servorum suorum singulos seorsum greges dixitque pueris suis: “Antecedite me, et sit spatium inter gregem et gregem”.
I can't!
Non possum!
And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee? thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau; and he cometh after us.
Et præcepit priori dicens: Si obvium habueris Esau fratrem meum, et interrogaverit te: "Cuius es?" et "Quo vadis?" et "Cuius sunt ista, quæ sequeris?", respondebis: "Servi tui Iacob; munera misit domino meo Esau. Ipse quoque post nos venit”.
In like manner he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him. And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us; for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.
Similiter mandata dedit secundo ac tertio et cunctis, qui sequebantur greges, dicens: "Iisdem verbis loquimini ad Esau, cum inveneritis eum, et addetis: Ipse quoque servus tuus Iacob iter nostrum insequitur". Dixit enim: Placabo illum muneribus, quæ præcedunt, et postea videbo faciem eius: forsitan propitiabitur mihi.
So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.
Præcesserunt itaque munera ante eum, ipse vero mansit nocte illa in castris.
And rising early, he took his two wives and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc. And when all things were brought over that belonged to him, he remained alone; and behold, a man wrestled with him till morning.
Cumque nocte surrexisset, tulit duas uxores suas et totidem famulas cum undecim filiis et transivit vadum Iaboc; sumptis ergo traductisque illis et omnibus, quæ ad se pertinebant, per torrentem, mansit solus. Et ecce vir luctabatur cum eo usque mane.
And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.
Qui cum videret quod eum superare non posset, tetigit acetabulum femoris eius, et statim luxatum est acetabulum femoris Iacob, cum luctaretur cum illo.
And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
Dixitque: “Dimitte me, iam enim ascendit aurora”. Respondit: “Non dimittam te, nisi benedixeris mihi”.
And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob.
Ait ad eum: “Quod nomen est tibi?” Respondit: “Iacob”.
But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?
At ille: “Nequaquam, inquit, Iacob amplius appellabitur nomen tuum, sed Israel: quoniam certasti cum Deo et cum hominibus et prævaluisti!”
Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.
Interrogavit eum Iacob: “Dic mihi, quo appellaris nomine?” Respondit: “Cur quæris nomen meum?” Et benedixit ei in eodem loco.
And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.
Vocavitque Iacob nomen loci illius Phanuel dicens: Vidi Deum facie ad faciem, et salva facta est anima mea.
And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.
Ortusque est ei sol, cum transgrederetur Phanuel; ipse vero claudicabat propter femur.
Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.
Quam ob causam non comedunt filii Israel nervum, qui est in femore, usque in præsentem diem, eo quod tetigerit nervum femoris Iacob.
And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids.
Elevans autem Iacob oculos suos vidit venientem Esau et cum eo quadringentos viros; divisitque filios Liæ et Rachel ambarumque famularum.
And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.
Et posuit utramque ancillam et liberos earum in principio, Liam vero et filios eius in secundo loco, Rachel autem et Ioseph novissimos.
And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times, until his brother came near.
Et ipse prægrediens adoravit pronus in terram septies, donec appropinquaret ad fratrem suum.
Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and embraced him: and clasping him fast about the neck, and kissing him, wept.
Currens itaque Esau obviam fratri suo amplexatus est eum; stringensque collum eius osculatus est eum, et fleverunt.
How old is that painting?
Quam vetus est illa tabula picta?
And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given to me, thy servant.
Levatisque oculis, vidit mulieres et liberos earum et ait: “Qui sunt isti tibi?” Respondit: “Liberi sunt, quos donavit mihi Deus servo tuo".
We didn't kill them.
Eos non occidimus.
This one's yours.
Hoc tuum est.
This is yours.
Hoc tuum est.
Then the handmaids and their children came near and bowed themselves.
Et appropinquantes ancillæ et filii earum incurvati sunt.
Lia also, with her children, came near and bowed down in like manner; and last of all, Joseph and Rachel bowed down.
Accessit quoque Lia cum liberis suis et, cum similiter adorassent, extremi Ioseph et Rachel adoraverunt.
And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favour before my lord.
“Quænam sunt, inquit, istæ turmæ, quas obvias habui?” Respondit: “Ut invenirem gratiam coram domino meo”.
But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.
At ille: Habeo, ait, plurima, frater mi; sint tua tibi.
And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of God: be gracious to me.
Dixit Iacob: Noli ita, obsecro; sed, si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, accipe munusculum de manibus meis; sic enim vidi faciem tuam quasi viderim vultum Dei, et mihi propitius fuisti.
Take the blessing which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who gives all things.
Suscipe, quæso, benedictionem, quæ allata est tibi; quia Deus misertus est mihi, et habeo omnia.
He took it with much ado at his brother's earnest pressing him, and said: Let us go together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.
Et, cum compelleret illum, suscepit et ait: Gradiamur simul, eroque socius itineris tui.
And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.
Dixit Iacob: Nosti, domine mi, quod parvulos habeam teneros et oves et boves fetas mecum; quas si plus in ambulando fecero laborare vel una die, morientur cuncti greges.
Now when these things were done, the word of the Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy reward exceeding great.
His itaque transactis, factus est sermo Domini ad Abram per visionem dicens: Noli timere, Abram! Ego protector tuus sum, et merces tua magna erit nimis.
And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou give me? I shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer.
Dixitque Abram: Domine Deus, quid dabis mihi? Ego vadam absque liberis, et heres domus meæ erit Damascenus Eliezer.
And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my servant born in my house shall be my heir.
Addiditque Abram: En mihi non dedisti semen, et ecce vernaculus meus heres meus erit.
And immediately the word of the Lord came to him, saying : He shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt thou have for thy heir.
Sed ecce sermo Domini factus est ad eum: Non erit hic heres tuus, sed qui egredietur de visceribus tuis, ipsum habebis heredem.
And he brought him forth abroad, and said to him: Look up to heaven and number the stars if thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy seed be.
Eduxitque eum foras, et ait illi: Suspice cælum, et numera stellas, si potes. Et dixit ei: Sic erit semen tuum.
Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.
Credidit Deo, et reputatum est ei ad iustitiam.
And he said to him: I am the Lord who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.
Dixitque ad eum: Ego Dominus, qui eduxi te de Ur Chaldæorum, ut darem tibi terram istam, et possideres eam.
But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know that I shall possess it?
Et ille ait: Domine Deus, unde scire possum quod possessurus sim eam?
And the Lord answered, and said: Take me a cow of three years old, and a she-goat of three years. and a ram of three years, a turtle also, and a pigeon.
Respondens Dominus: Sume, inquit, mihi vitulam triennem et capram trimam et arietem annorum trium, turturem quoque et columbam.
And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one against the other: but the birds he divided not.
Qui tollens universa hæc divisit ea per medium et utrasque partes contra se altrinsecus posuit; aves autem non divisit.
And the fowls came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
Descenderuntque volucres super cadavera, et abigebat eas Abram.
And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they shall bring them under bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.
Dictumque est ad eum: Scito prænoscens quod peregrinum futurum sit semen tuum in terra non sua, et subicient eos servituti et affligent quadringentis annis.
But I will judge the nation which they shall serve, and after this they shall come out with great substance.
Verumtamen et gentem, cui servituri sunt, ego iudicabo, et post hæc egredientur cum magna substantia.
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age.
Tu autem ibis ad patres tuos in pace, sepultus in senectute bona.
Tom is getting married next month.
Thomas proximo mense uxorem ducet.
You deserve everything you get.
Omnia quae recepturus es mereris.
What's the name of this bird?
Quid est nomen huius avis?
This garden is beautiful.
Hic hortus pulcher est.
May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.
Præcedat dominus meus ante servum suum; et ego sequar paulatim secundum gressum pecorum ante me et secundum gressum parvulorum, donec veniam ad dominum meum in Seir.
Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people, at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity. I want nothing else but only to find favour, my lord, in thy sight.
Respondit Esau: "Oro te, ut de populo, qui mecum est, saltem socii remaneant viae tuæ". "Non est, inquit, necesse; hoc uno indigeo, ut inveniam gratiam in conspectu domini mei”.
So Esau returned that day, the way that he came, to Seir.
Reversus est itaque illo die Esau itinere suo in Seir.
And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.
Et Iacob venit in Succoth, ubi, ædificata sibi domo et fixis tentoriis pro gregibus suis, appellavit nomen loci illius Succoth (id est Tabernacula).
And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Canaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town.
Transivitque Iacob incolumis ad urbem Sichem, quæ est in terra Chanaan, cum veniret de Paddanaram; et habitavit iuxta oppidum.
And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred lambs.
Emitque partem agri, in qua fixerat tabernaculum suum, a filiis Hemmor patris Sichem centum argenteis.
And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel.
Et erexit ibi altare et vocavit illud: Deus est Deus Israel.
And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country.
Egressa est autem Dina filia, quam Lia pepererat Iacob, ut videret filias regionis illius.
And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was in love with her: and took her away, and lay with her, ravishing the virgin.
Quam cum vidisset Sichem filius Hemmor Hevæi principis terræ illius, adamavit eam et rapuit; et dormivit cum illa, vi opprimens illam.
But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at the full until this present time.
Generatione autem quarta revertentur huc; necdum enim completæ sunt iniquitates Amorhæorum usque ad præsens tempus.
And when the sun was set, there arose a dark mist, and there appeared a smoking furnace, and a lamp of fire passing between those divisions.
Cum ergo occubuisset sol, facta est caligo tenebrosa, et apparuit clibanus fumans et lampas ignis transiens inter divisiones illas.
Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth no children: but having a handmaid, an Egyptian, named Agar, she said to her husband: Behold, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at least.
Sarai autem uxor Abram non genuerat ei liberos; sed habens ancillam Aeyptiam nomine Agar, dixit marito suo: Ecce conclusit me Dominus, ne parerem; ingredere ad ancillam meam, si forte saltem ex illa suscipiam filios.
And when he agreed to her request, she took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.
Cumque ille acquiesceret deprecanti, tulit Agar ægyptiam ancillam suam post annos decem quam habitare cœperant in terra Chanaan, et dedit eam viro suo uxorem.
And he went in to her. But she perceiving that she was with child, despised her mistress.
Qui ingressus est ad eam. At illa concepisse se videns despexit dominam suam.
And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.
Dixitque Sarai ad Abram: Inique agis contra me; ego dedi ancillam meam in sinum tuum, quæ videns quod conceperit, despectui me habet. Iudicet Dominus inter me et te.
And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.
Cui respondens Abram: Ecce, ait, ancilla tua in manu tua est, utere ea ut libet. Affligente igitur eam Sarai, aufugit ab ea.
And the angel of the Lord having found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert, he said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?
Cumque invenisset illam angelus Domini iuxta fontem aquæ in deserto, ad fontem in via Sur, dixit: Agar, ancilla Sarai, unde venis et quo vadis?
And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.
Quæ respondit: A facie Sarai dominæ meæ ego fugio.
And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.
Dixitque ei angelus Domini: Revertere ad dominam tuam et humiliare sub manibus ipsius.
And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Et dixit ei angelus Domini: Multiplicans multiplicabo semen tuum, et non numerabitur præ multitudine.
And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.
Et dixit ei angelus Domini: "Ecce, concepisti et paries filium vocabisque nomen eius Ismael, eo quod audierit Dominus afflictionem tuam.
He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all men's hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.
Hic erit homo onagro similis; manus eius contra omnes, et manus omnium contra eum; et e regione universorum fratrum suorum figet tabernacula.
And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.
Vocavit autem nomen Domini, qui loquebatur ad eam: "Tu Deus, qui vidisti me". Dixit enim: "Profecto hic vidi posteriora videntis me".
And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name Ismael.
Peperitque Agar Abræ filium; qui vocavit nomen filii sui, quem peperat Agar, Ismael.
Abram was four score and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael.
Octoginta et sex annorum erat Abram quando peperit ei Agar Ismaelem.
And after he began to be ninety and nine years old, the Lord appeared to him: and said unto him: I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be perfect.
Postquam Abram nonaginta et novem annorum factus est, apparuit ei Dominus dixitque ad eum: Ego Deus omnipotens, ambula coram me et esto perfectus.
And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.
Ponamque fœdus meum inter me et te et multiplicabo te vehementer nimis.
Abram fell flat on his face. And God said to him: I am, and my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: because I have made thee a father of many nations.
Cecidit Abram pronus in faciem. Dixitque ei Deus: Ecce pactum meum tecum. Erisque pater multarum gentium, nec ultra vocabitur nomen tuum Abram, sed Abraham erit nomen tuum, quia patrem multarum gentium constitui te.
And I will make thee increase exceedingly, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
Faciamque te crescere vehementissime et ponam te in gentes; regesque ex te egredientur.
And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and between thy seed after thee in their generations, by a perpetual covenant: to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.
Et statuam pactum meum inter me et te et inter semen tuum post te in generationibus suis fœdere sempiterno, ut sim Deus tuus et seminis tui post te.
An I will give to thee, and to thy seed, the land of thy sojournment, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual possession, and I will be their God.
Daboque tibi et semini tuo post te terram peregrinationis tuæ, omnem terram Chanaan in possessionem æternam; eroque Deus eorum.
Again God said to Abraham: And thou therefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
Dixit iterum Deus ad Abraham: Tu autem pactum meum custodies, et semen tuum post te in generationibus suis.
This is my covenant which you shall observe between me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male-kind of you shall be circumcised. And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant between me and you.
Hoc est pactum meum, quod observabitis, inter me et vos et semen tuum post te. Circumcidetur ex vobis omne masculinum, et circumcidetis carnem præputii vestri, ut sit in signum fœderis inter me et vos.
An infant of eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every manchild in your generations: he that is born in the house, as well as the bought servant, shall be circumcised, and whosoever is not of your stock.
Infans octo dierum circumcidetur in vobis: omne masculinum in generationibus vestris, tam vernaculus quam empticius ex omnibus alienigenis, quicumque non fuerit de stirpe vestra.
The male whose flesh of his foreskin shall not be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken my covenant.
Masculus, cuius præputii caro circumcisa non fuerit, delebitur anima illa de populo suo; pactum meum irritum fecit.
He that is born in the house, as well as the bought servant, shall be circumcised, and my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.
Circumcidetur vernaculus et empticius, eritque pactum meum in carne vestra in fœdus æternum.
God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara.
Dixit quoque Deus ad Abraham: Sarai uxorem tuam non vocabis nomen eius Sarai, sed Sara erit nomen eius.
And I will bless her, and of her I will give thee a son, whom I will bless, and he shall become nations, and kings of people shall spring from him.
Et benedicam ei; et ex illa quoque dabo tibi filium. Benedicturus sum eam, eritque in nationes; reges populorum orientur ex ea.
Abraham fell upon his face, and lauĝed, saying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou, be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth?
Cecidit Abraham in faciem suam et risit dicens in corde suo: Putasne centenario nascetur filius? Et Sara nonagenaria pariet?
And he said to God: O that Ismael may live before thee.
Dixitque ad Deum: Utinam Ismael vivat coram te.
And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, and with his seed after him.
Et ait Deus: Sara uxor tua pariet tibi filium, vocabisque nomen eius Isaac; et constituam pactum meum illi in fœdus sempiternum et semini eius post eum.
And as for Ismael I have also heard thee. Behold, I will bless him, and increase, and multiply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.
Super Ismael quoque exaudivi te: ecce benedicam ei et crescere faciam et multiplicabo eum vehementissime; duodecim duces generabit, et faciam illum in gentem magnam.
But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time in the next year.
Pactum vero meum statuam ad Isaac, quem pariet tibi Sara tempore isto in anno altero.
And when he had left off speaking with him, God went up from Abraham.
Cumque cessasset loqui cum eo, ascendit Deus ab Abraham.
And Abraham took Ismael his son, and all that were born in his house: and all whom he had bought, every male among the men of his house: and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin forthwith the very same day, as God had commanded him.
Tulit ergo Abraham Ismael filium suum et omnes vernaculos domus suæ universosque, quos emerat: cunctos mares ex omnibus viris domus suæ; et circumcidit carnem præputii eorum statim in ipsa die, sicut præceperat ei Deus.
Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and Ismael his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his circumcision. .
Abraham nonaginta novem erat annorum, quando circumcisus est in carne præputii sui; et Ismael filius eius tredecim annos impleverat tempore circumcisionis suæ.
The self-same day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael his son. And all the men of his house, as well they that were born in his house, as the bought servants and strangers, were circumcised with him.
Eadem die circumcisus est Abraham et Ismael filius eius; et omnes viri domus illius, tam vernaculi, quam empticii ex alienigenis, circumcisi sunt cum eo.
And the Lord appeared to him in the vale of Mambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent, in the very heat of the day.
Apparuit autem ei Dominus iuxta Quercus Mambre sedenti in ostio tabernaculi sui in ipso fervore diei.
And when he had lifted up his eyes, there appeared to him three men standing near to him: and as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and adored down to the ground.
Cumque elevasset oculos, apparuerunt ei tres viri stantes prope eum. Quos cum vidisset, cucurrit in occursum eorum de ostio tabernaculi ed adoravit in terram.
And he said: Lord, if I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away from thy servant.
Et dixit: Domine mi, si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, ne transeas servum tuum.
But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye your feet, and rest ye under the tree.
Afferatur pauxillum aquæ, et lavate pedes vestros et requiescite sub arbore.
And I will set a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall pass on: for therefore are you come aside to your servant.
Ponamque buccellam panis, et confortate cor vestrum, postea transibitis; idcirco enim declinastis ad servum vestrum.
And they said: Do as thou hast spoken.
Qui dixerunt: Fac ut locutus es.
Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara, and said to her: Make haste, temper together three measures of flour, and make cakes upon the hearth.
Festinavit Abraham in tabernaculum ad Saram dixitque: Accelera, tria sata similæ commisce et fac subcinericios panes.
And he himself ran to the herd, and took from thence a calf, very tender and very good, and gave it to a young man, who made haste and boiled it.
Ipse vero ad armentum cucurrit et tulit inde vitulum tenerrimum et optimum deditque puero; qui festinavit et coxit illum.
He took also butter and milk, and the calf which he had boiled, and set before them: but he stood by them under the tree.
Tulit quoque butyrum et lac et vitulum, quem coxerat, et posuit coram eis. Ipse vero stabat iuxta eos sub arbore; et comederunt.
And when they had eaten, they said to him: Where is Sara thy wife? He answered: Lo she is in the tent.
Dixeruntque ad eum: "Ubi est Sara uxor tua?" Ille respondit: "Ecce in tabernaculo est".
And he said to him: I will return and come to thee at this time, life accompanying, and Sara, thy wife, shall have a son. Which when Sara heard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.
Cui dixit: "Revertens veniam ad te tempore isto, et habebit filium Sara uxor tua". Quo audito, Sara risit ad ostium tabernaculi, quod era post eum.
Now they were both old, and far advanced in years, and it had ceased to be with Sara after the manner of women.
Erant autem ambo senes provectæque ætatis, et desierant Saræ fieri muliebria.
And she laughed secretly, saying: After I am grown old, and my lord is an old man, shall I give myself to pleasure?
Quæ risit occulte dicens: Postquam consenui, et dominus meus vetulus est, voluptas mihi erit?
And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did Sara laugh, saying: Shall I, who am an old woman, bear a child indeed?
Dixit autem Dominus ad Abraham: Quare risit Sara dicens: "Num vere paritura sum anus?"
Is there any thing hard to God? According to appointment I will return to thee at this same time, life accompanying, and Sara shall have a son.
Numquid Domino est quidquam difficile? Revertar ad te hoc eodem tempore, et habebit Sara filium.
Sara denied, saying: I did not laugh: for she was afraid. But the Lord said: Nay; but thou didst laugh.
Negavit Sara dicens: "Non risi", timore perterrita. Ille autem dixit: "Non; sed risisti".
And when the men rose up from thence, they turned their eyes towards Sodom: and Abraham walked with them, bringing them on the way.
Cum ergo surrexissent inde viri, direxerunt oculos contra Sodomam; et Abraham simul gradiebatur deducens eos.
And the Lord said: Can I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed?
Dixitque Dominus: Num celare potero Abraham, quæ gesturus sum, cum futurus sit gentem magnam ac robustissimam, et benedicendæ sint in illo omnes nationes terræ?
For I know that he will command his children, and his household after him, to keep the way of the Lord, and do judgment and justice: that for Abraham's sake, the Lord may bring to effect all the things he hath spoken unto him.
Nam elegi eum, ut præcipiat filiis suis et domui suæ post se, ut custodiant viam Domini et faciant iustitiam et iudicium, ut adducat Dominus super Abraham omnia, quæ locutus est ad eum.
And the Lord said: The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become exceedingly grievous.
Dixit itaque Dominus: Clamor contra Sodomam et Gomorram multiplicatus est, et peccatum eorum aggravatum est nimis.
I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry that is come to me; or whether it be not so, that I may know.
Descendam et videbo utrum clamorem, qui venit ad me, opere compleverint an non; sciam.
And they turned themselves from thence, and went their way to Sodom: but Abraham as yet stood before the Lord.
Converteruntque se inde viri et abierunt Sodomam; Abraham vero adhuc stabat coram Domino.
And drawing nigh, he said: Wilt thou destroy the just with the wicked?
Et appropinquans ait: Numquid vere perdes iustum cum impio?
If there be fifty just men in the city, shall they perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just, if they be therein?
Si forte fuerint quinquaginta iusti in civitate, vere perdes et non parces loco illi propter quinquaginta iustos, si fuerint in eo?
Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to slay the just with the wicked, and for the just to be in like case as the wicked; this is not beseeming thee: thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not make this judgment.
Absit a te, ut rem hanc facias et occidas iustum cum impio, fiatque iustus sicut impius; absit a te. Nonne iudex universæ terræ faciet iudicium?
And the Lord said to him: If I find in Sodom fifty just within the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.
Dixitque Dominus: Si invenero Sodomæ quinquaginta iustos in medio civitas, dimittam omni loco propter eos.
And Abraham answered, and said: Seeing I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and ashes.
Respondensque Abraham ait: Ecce cœpi loqui ad Dominum meum cum sim pulvis et cinis.
What if there be five less than fifty just persons? wilt thou for five and forty destroy the whole city: And he said: I will not destroy it, if I find five and forty.
"Quid, si forte minus quinquaginta iustis quinque fuerint? Delebis propter quinque universam urbem?" Et ait: "Non delebo, si invenero ibi quadraginta quinque".
And again he said to him: But if forty be found there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of forty.
Rursumque locutus est ad eum: "Si forte inventi fuerint ibi quadraginta?" Ait: "Non percutiam propter quadraginta".
Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee, if I speak: What if thirty shall be found there? He answered: I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
"Ne, quæso, inquit, indignetur Dominus meus, si loquar. Si forte ibi inventi fuerint triginta?" Ait: "Non faciam, si invenero ibi triginta."
Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord: What if twenty be found there? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.
"Ecce, ait, cœpi loqui ad Dominum meum. Si forte inventi fuerint ibi viginti?" Dixit: "Non interficiam propter viginti".
I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord, if I speak yet once more: What if ten shall be found there? And he said: I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.
"Obsecro, inquit, ne irascatur Dominus meus, si loquar adhuc semel. Si forte inventi fuerint ibi decem?" Dixit: "Non delebo propter decem".
And the Lord departed, after he had left speaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.
Abiit Dominus, postquam cessavit loqui ad Abraham; et ille reversus est in locum suum.
And his soul was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.
Et conglutinata est anima eius cum ea, et amavit puellam et locutus est ad cor eius.
And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get me this damsel to wife.
Dixitque ad Hemmor patrem suum: Accipe mihi puellam hanc coniugem.
But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.
Cum audisset Iacob quod violasset Dinam filiam suam, absentibus filiis et in pastu pecorum occupatis, siluit, donec redirent.
And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob, behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what had passed, they were exceeding angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Jacob's daughter.
Egresso autem Hemmor patre Sichem, ut loqueretur ad Iacob, ecce filii Iacob veniebant de agro, auditoque, quod acciderat, contristati et irati sunt valde, eo quod fœdam rem esset operatus in Israel et, violata filia Iacob, rem illicitam perpetrasset.
And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give her him to wife: and let us contract marriages one with another: give us your daughters, and take you our daughters.
Locutus est itaque Hemmor ad eos: Sichem filii mei adhæsit anima filiæ vestræ; date eam illi uxorem, et iungamus vicissim conubia: filias vestras tradite nobis et filias nostras accipite vobis.
And dwell with us: the land is at your command, till, trade, and possess it.
Et habitate nobiscum; terra in potestate vestra est: manete, perambulate et possidete eam.
Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren: Let me find favour in your sight, and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:
Sed et Sichem ad patrem et ad fratres eius ait: Inveniam gratiam coram vobis et, quæcumque statueritis, dabo.
They're not good.
Non boni sunt.
Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you shall demand: only give me this damsel to wife.
Augete mihi valde dotem et munera; libens tribuam, quod petieritis. Tantum date mihi puellam hanc uxorem.
Where's your sister?
Ubi soror tua est?
The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully, being enraged at the deflowering of their sister: We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; which with us is unlawful and abominable.
Responderunt filii Iacob Sichem et Hemmor patri eius in dolo ob stuprum sororis: Non possumus facere, quod petitis, dare sororem nostram homini incircumciso, opprobrium enim esset nobis.
But in this we may be allied with you, if you will be like us, and all the male sex among you be circumcised:Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:
In hoc tantum valebimus acquiescere vobis: si esse volueritis similes nostri, circumcidatur in vobis omne masculini sexus; tunc dabimus et accipiemus mutuo filias nostras ac vestras et habitabimus vobiscum erimusque unus populus.
But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.
Si autem circumcidi nolueritis, tollemus filiam nostram et recedemus.
Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his son: And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what was required: for he loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father's house.
Placuit oblatio eorum Hemmor et Sichem filio eius, nec distulit adulescens quin statim, quod petebatur, expleret; amabat enim filiam Iacob valde, et ipse erat inclitus in omni domo patris sui.
And going into the gate of the city, they spoke to the people: These men are peaceable, and are willing to dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and till it, which being large and wide wanteth men to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives, and we will give them ours.
Ingressique portam urbis, Hemmor et Sichem filius eius locuti sunt ad viros civitatis suæ: Viri isti pacifici sunt erga nos; maneant in terra et perambulent eam, quæ spatiosa et lata est eis; filias eorum accipiemus uxores et nostras illis dabimus.
One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred: We must circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation. And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.
Tantum in hoc valebunt viri acquiescere nobis, ut maneant nobiscum et efficiamur unus populus, si circumcidamus masculos nostros ritum gentis imitantes; et pecora et substantia et armenta eorum nostra erunt. Tantum in hoc acquiescamus, et habitabunt nobiscum.
And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.
Assensique sunt omnes, circumcisis cunctis maribus, qui egrediebantur e porta civitatis suæ.
And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was greatest: two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city and slew all the men. And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister Dina out of Sichem's house.
Et ecce, die tertio, quando gravissimus vulnerum dolor est, arreptis duo filii Iacob Simeon et Levi fratres Dinæ gladiis, ingressi sunt urbem securi; interfectisque omnibus masculis, Hemmor et Sichem pariter necaverunt, tollentes Dinam de domo Sichem sororem suam.
And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.
Filii Iacob irruerunt super occisos, et depopulati sunt urbem in ultionem stupri.
And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in their fields.
Oves eorum et armenta et asinos cunctaque, quæ in civitate et in agris erant, tulerunt.
And their children and wives they took captive.
Omnes opes eorum, parvulos quoque et uxores duxerunt captivas et diripuerunt omnia, quæ in domibus erant.
And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land. We are few: they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my house shall be destroyed.
Iacob autem dixit ad Simeon et Levi: Turbastis me et odiosum fecistis me Chananæis et Pherezæis habitatoribus terræ huius. Nos pauci sumus; illi congregati percutient me, et delebor ego et domus mea.
They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?
Responderunt: Numquid ut scorto abuti debuere sorore nostra?
And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of the city. And seeing them, he rose up and went to meet them: and worshipped prostrate to the ground. And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the house of your servant, and lodge there: wash your feet, and in the morning you shall go on your way.
Veneruntque duo angeli Sodomam vespere, sedente Lot in foribus civitatis. Qui cum vidisset eos, surrexit et ivit obviam eis adoravitque pronus in terram et dixit: "Obsecro, domini mei, declinate in domum pueri vestri et pernoctate; lavate pedes vestros et mane proficiscemini in viam vestram".
And they said: No, but we will abide in the street.
Qui dixerunt: Minime, sed in platea pernoctabimus.
He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and when they were come into his house, he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate:
Compulit illos oppido, et diverterunt ad eum. Ingressisque domum illius fecit convivium et coxit azyma, et comederunt.
But before they went to bed, the men of the city beset the house, both young and old, all the people together.
Prius autem quam irent cubitum, viri civitatis, viri Sodomæ, vallaverunt domum a iuvene usque ad senem, omnis populus simul.
And they called Lot, and said to him: Where are the men that came in to thee at night? bring them out hither, that we may know them:
Vocaveruntque Lot et dixerunt ei: Ubi sunt viri, qui introierunt ad te nocte? Educ illos ad nos, ut cognoscamus eos.
Lot went out to them, and shut the door after him, and said: Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit this evil.
Egressus ad eos Lot post tergum occludens ostium ait: Nolite, quæso, fratres mei, nolite malum hoc facere.
I have two daughters who, as yet, have not known man; I will bring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so that you do no evil to these men, because they are come in under the shadow of my roof.
Ecce, habeo duas filias, quæ necdum cognoverunt virum; educam eas ad vos, et facite eis sicut placuerit vobis, dummodo viris istis nihil faciatis, ideo enim ingressi sunt sub umbra tecti mei.
But they said: Get thee back thither. And again: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger, was it to be a judge? therefore we will afflict thee more than them. And they pressed very violently upon Lot: and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.
At illi dixerunt: "Recede illuc". Et rursus: "Unus ingressus est, inquiunt, ut advena et vult iudicare? Te ergo ipsum magis quam hos affligemus". Vimque faciebant Lot vehementissime, iamque prope erat, ut effringerent fores.
And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.
Et ecce miserunt manum viri et introduxerunt ad se Lot clauseruntque ostium.
And them, that were without, they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.
Et eos, qui foris erant, percusserunt cæcitate a minimo usque ad maximum, ita ut ostium invenire non possent.
And they said to Lot: Hast thou here any of thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring them out of this city: For we will destroy this place, because their cry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent us to destroy them.
Dixerunt autem viri ad Lot: Habes hic quempiam tuorum? Generum et filios et filias et omnes, qui tui sunt in urbe, educ de loco hoc: delebimus enim locum istum, eo quod increverit clamor contra eos coram Domino, qui misit nos, ut perdamus eam.
So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law that were to have his daughters, and said: Arise: get you out of this place, because the Lord will destroy this city. And he seemed to them to speak as it were in jest.
Egressus itaque Lot locutus est ad generos suos, qui accepturi erant filias eius, et dixit: "Surgite, egredimini de loco isto, quia delebit Dominus civitatem". Et visus est eis quasi ludens loqui.
And when it was morning, the angels pressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the city.
Cumque esset mane, cogebant eum angeli dicentes: Surge, tolle uxorem tuam et duas filias, quas habes hic, ne pereas in scelere civitatis.
And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters, because the Lord spared him.
Tardante illo, apprehenderunt viri manum eius et manum uxoris ac duarum filiarum eius, eo quod parceret Dominus illi. Et eduxerunt eum posueruntque extra civitatem.
And they brought him forth, and set him without the city: and there they spoke to him, saying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but save thy self in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.
Ibi locutus est: Salvare, agitur de vita tua; noli respicere post tergum, nec stes in omni circa regione; sed in monte salvum te fac, ne pereas.
And Lot said to them: I beseech thee, my Lord, Because thy servant hath found grace before thee, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil seize me, and I die.
Dixitque Lot ad eos: Non, quæso, Domine. Ecce invenit servus tuus gratiam coram te, et magnificasti misericordiam tuam, quam fecisti mecum, ut salvares animam meam; nec possum in monte salvari, ne forte apprehendat me malum et moriar.
There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in it: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?
Ecce, civitas hæc iuxta, ad quam possum fugere, parva, et salvabor in ea numquid non modica est? et vivet anima mea.
And he said to him: Behold also in this, I have heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.
Dixitque ad eum: Ecce, etiam in hoc suscepi preces tuas, ut non subvertam urbem, pro qua locutus es.
Make haste, and be saved there: because I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither. Therefore the name of that city was called Segor.
"Festina et salvare ibi, quia non potero facere quidquam, donec ingrediaris illuc". Idcirco vocatum est nomen urbis illius Segor.
The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor.
Sol egressus est super terram, et Lot ingressus est Segor.
And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he destroyed these cities, and all the country about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring from the earth.
Igitur Dominus pluit super Sodomam et Gomorram sulphur et ignem a Domino de cælo et subvertit civitates has et omnem circa regionem, universos habitatores urbium et cuncta terræ virentia.
And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statue of salt.
Respiciensque uxor eius post se versa est in statuam salis.
And Abraham got up early in the morning, and in the place where he had stood before with the Lord: He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and the whole land of that country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.
Abraham autem consurgens mane venit ad locum, ubi steterat prius cum Domino, intuitus est Sodomam et Gomorram et universam terram regionis illius; viditque ascendentem favillam de terra quasi fornacis fumum.
Now when God destroyed the cities of that country, remembering Abraham, he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt.
Cum enim subverteret Deus civitates regionis illius, recordatus Abrahæ liberavit Lot de subversione urbium, in quibus habitaverat.
And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode in the mountain, and his two daughters with him (for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.
Ascenditque Lot de Segor et mansit in monte, duæ quoque filiæ eius cum eo; timuerat enim manere in Segor. Et mansit in spelunca ipse et duæ filiæ eius.
And the elder said to the younger: Our father is old, and there is no man left on the earth, to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth.
Dixitque maior ad minorem: Pater noster senex est, et nullus virorum remansit in terra, qui possit ingredi ad nos iuxta morem universæ terræ.
Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Veni, inebriemus patrem nostrum vino dormiamusque cum eo, ut servare possimus ex patre nostro semen.
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the elder went in, and lay with her father: but he perceived not, neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.
Dederunt itaque patri suo bibere vinum nocte illa, et ingressa est maior dormivitque cum patre; at ille non sensit, nec quando acccubuit filia nec quando surrexit.
And the next day the elder said to the younger: Behold I lay last night with my father, let us make him drink wine also to night, and thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed of our father.
Altera quoque die dixit maior ad minorem: Ecce, dormivi heri cum patre meo; demus ei bibere vinum etiam hac nocte, et ingressa dormies cum eo, ut salvemus semen de patre nostro.
They made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in, and lay with him: and neither then did he perceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.
Dederunt et illa nocte patri suo bibere vinum, ingressaque minor flia dormivit cum eo; et ne tunc quidem sensit, quando illa concubuerit vel quando surrexit.
So the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
Conceperunt ergo duæ filiæ Lot de patre suo.
And the elder bore a son, and she called his name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
Peperitque maior filium et vocavit nomen eius Moab; ipse est pater Moabitarum usque in præsentem diem.
The younger also bore a son, and she called his name Ammon; that is, the son of my people: he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.
Minor quoque peperit filium et vocavit nomen eius Benammi (id est Filius populi mei); ipse est pater Ammonitarum usque hodie.
Abraham removed from thence to the south country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.
Profectus inde Abraham in terram Nageb, habitavit inter Cades et Sur et peregrinatus est in Geraris.
And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister. So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took her.
Dixitque de Sara uxore sua: "Soror mea est". Misit ergo Abimelech rex Geraræ et tulit eam.
And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a husband.
Venit autem Deus ad Abimelech per somnium nocte et ait illi: En morieris propter mulierem, quem tulisti; habet enim virum.
Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is ignorant and just?
Abimelech vero non tetigerat eam. Et ait: Domine, num gentem etiam justam interficies?
Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and she say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done this.
Nonne ipse dixit mihi: "Soror mea est", et ipsa quoque ait: "Frater meus est"? In simplicitate cordis mei et munditia manuum mearum feci hoc.
And God said to him: And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I suffered thee not to touch her.
Dixitque ad eum Deus per somnium: Et ego scio quod simplici corde feceris; et ideo custodivi te, ne peccares in me, et non dimisi, ut tangeres eam.
Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her, know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.
Nunc igitur redde viro suo uxorem, quia propheta est; et orabit pro te, et vives; si autem nolueris reddere, scito quod morte morieris tu et omnia, quæ tua sunt.
And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night, called all his servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing, and all the men were exceedingly afraid.
Statimque de nocte consurgens Abimelech vocavit omnes servos suos et locutus est universa verba hæc in auribus eorum; timueruntque viri valde.
And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to him: What hast thou done to us? what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do.
Vocavit autem Abimelech etiam Abraham et dixit ei: Quid fecisti nobis? Quid peccavi in te, qui induxisti super me et super regnum meum peccatum grande? Quæ non debuisti facere, fecisti mihi.
And again he expostulated with him, and said: What sawest thou, that thou hast done this?
Rursusque ait: Quid vidisti, ut hoc faceres?
Abraham answered: I thought with myself, saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of my wife:
Respondit Abraham: Cogitavi mecum: Certe non est timor Dei in loco isto, et interficient me propter uxorem meam.
Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.
Alias autem et vere soror mea est, filia patris mei et non filia matris meæ, et duxi eam in uxorem.
And after God brought me out of my father's house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place, to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.
Cum autem vagari me faceret Deus de domo patris mei, dixi ad eam: Hanc misericordiam facies mecum: in omni loco, ad quem ingrediemur, dices quod frater tuus sim.
And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham: and restored to him Sara his wife. And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall please thee.
Tulit igitur Abimelech oves et boves et servos et ancillas et dedit Abraham; reddiditque illi Saram uxorem suam et ait: Ecce terra mea coram te; ubicumque tibi placuerit, habita.
And to Sara he said: Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember thou wast taken.
Saræ autem dixit: Ecce mille argenteos dedi fratre tuo; ecce hoc erit tibi in velamen oculorum ad omnes, qui tecum sunt, et apud omnes iustificaberis.
And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children: For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech, on account of Sara, Abraham's wife.
Orante autem Abraham, sanavit Deus Abimelech et uxorem ancillasque eius et pepererunt; concluserat enim Dominus omnem vulvam domus Abimelech propter Saram uxorem Abraham.
I have no religion.
Nullam religionem habeo.
I don't want to see you here again.
Nolo hic iterum te videre.
They'll try again.
Iterum temptabunt.
In the mean time God said to Jacob: Arise and go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou didst flee from Esau, thy brother.
Locutus est Deus ad Iacob: Surge et ascende Bethel et habita ibi; facque altare Deo, qui apparuit tibi, quando fugiebas Esau fratrem tuum.
And Jacob having called together all his household, said: Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be cleansed, and change your garments.
Iacob vero, convocata omni domo sua, ait: Abigite deos alienos, qui in medio vestri sunt, et mundamini ac mutate vestimenta vestra.
Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we may make there an altar to God; who heard me in the day of my affliction, and accompained me in my journey.
Surgamus et ascendamus in Bethel, ut faciamus ibi altare Deo, qui exaudivit me in die tribulationis meæ et socius fuit itineris mei.
So they gave him all the strange gods they had, and the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of Sichem.
Dederunt ergo ei omnes deos alienos, quos habebant, et inaures, quæ erant in auribus eorum; at ille infodit ea subter Quercum, quæ est prope urbem Sichem.
And when they were departed, the terror of God fell upon all the cities round about, and they durst not pursue after them as they went away.
Cumque profecti essent, terror Dei invasit omnes per circuitum civitates, et non sunt ausi persequi filios Iacob.
And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of Canaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all the people that were with him.
Venit igitur Iacob Luzam, quæ est in terra Chanaan, id est Bethel, ipse et omnis populus cum eo.
And he built there an altar, and called the name of that place, The house of God: for there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother.
Aedificavitque ibi altare et appellavit nomen loci illius Deus Bethel; ibi enim apparuit ei Deus, cum fugeret fratrem suum.
At the same time Debora, the nurse of Rebecca, died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel, under an oak, and the name of that place was called, The oak of weeping.
Eodem tempore mortua est Debora nutrix Rebeccæ et sepulta est ad radices Bethel subter quercum; vocatumque est nomen loci illius Quercus fletus.
And God appeared again to Jacob, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he blessed him, saying: Thou shalt not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called him Israel.
Apparuit iterum Deus Iacob, postquam reversus est de Paddanaram, benedixitque ei dicens: "Non vocaberis ultra Iacob, sed Israel erit nomen tuum”, et appellavit eum Israel.
And said to him: I am God almighty, increase thou and be multiplied. Nations and peoples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
Dixitque ei: Ego Deus omnipotens. Cresce et multiplicare; gens et congregatio nationum erunt ex te, reges de lumbis tuis egredientur.
And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee.
Terramque, quam dedi Abraham et Isaac, dabo tibi; et semini tuo post te dabo terram hanc.
I'm free now.
Nunc liber sum.
And he departed from him.
Et ascendit ab eo Deus.
But he set up a monument of stone, in the place where God had spoken to him: pouring drink-offerings upon it, and pouring oil thereon: and calling the name of that place Bethel.
Ille vero erexit titulum lapideum in loco, quo locutus ei fuerat Deus, libans super eum libamina et effundens oleum vocansque nomen loci illius Bethel.
And going forth from thence, he came in the spring time to the land which leadeth to Ephrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail, by reason of her hard labour, she began to be in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear not, for thou shalt have this son also.
Egressi sunt de Bethel. Et adhuc spatium quoddam erat usque ad Ephratham, cum parturiret Rachel; ob difficultatem partus periclitari cœpit, dixitque ei obstetrix: Noli timere, quia et hac vice habes filium.
And when her soul was departing for pain, and death was now at hand, she called the name of her son Benoni, that is, the son of my pain: but his father called him Benjamin, that is, the son of the right hand.
Egrediente autem anima et imminente iam morte, vocavit nomen filii sui Benoni (id est Filius doloris mei); pater vero appellavit eum Beniamin (id est Filius dextræ).
So Rachel died, and was buried in the highway that leadeth to Ephrata, this is Bethlehem.
Mortua est ergo Rachel et sepulta est in via, quæ ducit Ephratham; hæc est Bethlehem.
And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepulchre: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to this day.
Erexitque Iacob titulum super sepulcrum eius; hic est titulus monumenti Rachel usque in præsentem diem.
Departing thence, he pitched his tent beyond the Flock tower.
Egressus inde Israel, fixit tabernaculum trans Magdaleder (id est Turris gregis).
And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben went, and slept with Bala the concubine of his father: which he was not ignorant of.
Cumque habitaret in illa regione, abiit Ruben et dormivit cum Bilha concubina patris sui; quod illum minime latuit.
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
Erant autem filii Iacob duodecim.
And he came to Isaac his father in Mambre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherein Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
Venit Iacob ad Isaac patrem suum in Mambre Cariatharbe, id est Hebron, ubi peregrinatus est Abraham et Isaac.
And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. And being spent with age he died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Et completi sunt dies Isaac centum octoginta annorum; consumptusque ætate mortuus est et appositus est populo suo senex et plenus dierum. Et sepelierunt eum Esau et Iacob filii sui.
And Esau took his wives, and his sons and daughters, and every soul of his house, and his substance, and cattle, and all that he was able to acquire in the land of Canaan: and went into another country, and departed from his brother Jacob.
Tulit autem Esau uxores suas et filios et filias et omnes animas domus suæ et pecora armenta et cuncta, quæ acquisierat in terra Chanaan, et abiit in terram Seir; recessitque a fratre suo Iacob.
For they were exceeding rich, and could not dwell together: neither was the land in which they sojourned able to bear them, for the multitude of their flocks.
Divites enim erant valde et simul habitare non poterant; nec sustinebat eos terra peregrinationis eorum præ multitudine gregum.
And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken. And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her.
Visitavit autem Dominus Saram, sicut promiserat, et implevi Saræ, quæ locutus est; concepitque et peperit Abrahæ filium in senectute eius tempore, quo prædixerat ei Deus.
And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, Isaac.
Vocavitque Abraham nomen filii sui, quem genuit ei Sara, Isaac.
And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him.
Et circumcidit eum octavo die, sicut præceperat ei Deus.
When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father, was Isaac born.
Cum Abraham centum esset annorum, natus est ei Isaac filius eius.
And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.
Dixitque Sara: Risum fecit mihi Deus; quicumque audierit, corridebit mihi.
And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age?
Rursumque ait: Quis auditurum crederet Abraham quod Sara lacteret filios, quia peperit ei filium iam seni?
And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.
Crevit igitur puer et ablactatus est. Fecitque Abraham grande convivium in die ablactationis eius.
And when Sara had seen the son of Agar, the Egyptian, playing with Isaac, her son, she said to Abraham: Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.
Cumque vidisset Sara filium Agar Aegyptiæ iocantem cum Isaac filio suo, dixit ad Abraham: Eice ancillam hanc et filium eius; non enim erit heres filius ancillæ cum filio meo Isaac.
Abraham took this grievously for his son.
Dure accepit hoc Abraham propter filium suum.
And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Cui dixit Deus: Non tibi videatur asperum super puero et super ancilla tua; omnia, quæ dixerit tibi Sara, audi vocem eius, quia in Isaac vocabitur tibi semen.
But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.
Sed et filium ancillæ faciam in gentem magnam, quia semen tuum est.
So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.
Surrexit itaque Abraham mane et tollens panem et utrem aquæ imposuit scapulæ eius tradiditque puerum et dimisit eam. Quæ cum abisset, errabat in deserto Bersabee.
And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there. And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off, as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.
Cumque consumpta esset aqua in utre, abiecit puerum subter unum arbustum et abiit; seditque e regione procul, quantum potest arcus iacere. Dixit enim: "Non videbo morientem puerum". Et sedens contra levavit vocem suam et flevit.
And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.
Exaudivit autem Deus vocem pueri; vocavitque angelus Dei Agar de cælo dicens: Quid tibi, Agar? Noli timere; exaudivit enim Deus vocem pueri de loco, in quo est.
Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.
Surge, tolle puerum et tene illum manu tua, quia in gentem magnam faciam eum.
And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.
Aperuitque Deus oculos eius; quæ videns puteum aquæ abiit et implevit utrem deditque puero bibere.
And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.
Et fuit Deus cum eo; qui crevit et moratus est in solitudine factusque est iuvenis sagittarius.
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
Habitavitque in deserto Pharan; et accepit illi mater sua uxorem de terra Aegypti.
At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army, said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost.
Eodem tempore dixit Abimelech et Phicol princeps exercitus eius ad Abraham: Deus tecum est in universis, quæ agis.
Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.
Iura ergo per Deum, ne noceas mihi et posteris meis stirpique meæ; sed iuxta fidem, quam feci tibi, facies mihi et terræ, in qua versatus es advena.
And Abraham said: I will swear.
Dixitque Abraham: Ego iurabo.
And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.
Et increpavit Abraham Abimelech propter puteum aquæ, quem vi abstulerant servi eius.
And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.
Responditque Abimelech: Nescivi quis fecerit hanc rem; sed et tu non indicasti mihi, et ego non audivi præter hodie.
Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.
Tulit itaque Abraham oves et boves et dedit Abimelech; percusseruntque ambo fœdus.
And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of the flock. And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?
Et statuit Abraham septem agnas gregis seorsum. Cui dixit Abimelech: Quid sibi volunt septem agnæ istæ, quas stare fecisti seorsum?
But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewelambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.
At ille: Septem, inquit, agnas accipies de manu mea, ut sint in testimonium mihi, quoniam ego fodi puteum istum.
Therefore that place was called Bersabee; because there both of them did swear.
Idcirco vocatus est locus ille Bersabee, quia uterque iuraverunt.
And they made a league for the well of oath. And Abimelech and Phicol, the general of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Palestines.
Et inierunt fœdus in Bersabee. Surrexit autem Abimelech et Phicol princeps militiæ eius reversique sunt in terram Philisthim.
But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.
Abrahm vero plantavit nemus in Bersabee et invocavit ibi nomem Domini, Dei æterni.
And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.
Et fuit colonus in terra Philisthim diebus multis.
After these things, God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.
Quæ postquam gesta sunt, tentavit Deus Abaham et dixit ad eum: "Abraham". Ille respondit: "Adsum".
He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision; and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee.
Ait: Tolle filium tuum unigenitum, quem diligis, Isaac et vade in terram Moria; atque offer eum ibi in holocaustum super unum montium, quem monstravero tibi.
So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass, and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust, he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.
Igitur Abraham de nocte consurgens stravit asinum suum ducens secum duos iuvenes suos et Isaac filium suum. Cumque concidisset ligna in holocaustum, surrexit et abiit ad locum, quem præceperat ei Deus.
And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off. And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass; I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you.
Die autem tertio, elevatis oculis, vidit locum procul dixitque ad pueros suos: Exspectate hic cum asino. Ego et puer illuc usque properantes, postquam adoraverimus, revertemur ad vos.
And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword.
Tulit quoque ligna holocausti et imposuit super Isaac filium suum; ipse vero portabat in manibus ignem et cultrum.
And as they two went on together, Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust?
Cumque duo pergerent simul, dixit Isaac Abrahæ patri suo: "Pater mi". Ille respondit: "Quid vis, fili?" "Ecce, inquit, ignis et ligna; ubi est victima holocausti?"
And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together.
Dixit Abraham: "Deus providebit sibi victimam holocausti, fili mi". Pergebant ambo pariter.
And they came to the place which God had shewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.
Et venerunt ad locum, quem ostenderat ei Deus, in quo ædificavit Abraham altare et desuper ligna composuit. Cumque colligasset Isaac filium suum, posuit eum in altari super struem lignorum.
And he put forth his hand, and took the sword, to sacrifice his son.
Extenditque Abraham manum et arripuit cultrum, ut immolaret filium suum.
And behold, an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.
Et ecce angelus Domini de cælo clamavit: "Abraham, Abraham". Qui respondit: "Adsum".
And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.
Dixitque: Non extendas manum tuam super puerum neque facias illi quidquam. Nunc cognovi quod times Deum et non pepercisti filio tuo unigenito propter me.
Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.
Levavit Abraham oculos suos viditque arietem unum inter vepres hærentem cornibus; quem assumens obtulit holocaustum pro filo.
And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see.
Appellavitque nomen loci illius: "Dominus videt". Unde usque hodie dicitur: "In monte Dominus videtur".
And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying: By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake: I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.
Vocavit autem angelus Domini Abraham secundo de cælo et dixit: "Per metipsum iuravi, dicit Dominus: quia fecisti hanc rem et non pepercisti filio tuo unigenito, benedicam tibi et multiplicabo semen tuum sicut stellas cæli et velut arenam, quæ est in litore maris. Possidebit semen tuum portas inimicorum suorum, et benedicentur en semine tuo omnes gentes terræ, quia obœdisti voci meæ".
Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.
Reversus est Abraham ad pueros suos, et surrexerunt abieruntque Bersabee simul, et habitavit Abraham in Bersabee.
And Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven years.
Vixit autem Sara centum viginti septem annis.
And she died in the city of Arbee which is Hebron, in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn and weep for her.
Et mortua est in Cariatharbe, quæ est Hebron, in terra Chanaan; venitque Abraham, ut plangeret et fleret eam.
And after he rose up from the funeral obsequies, he spoke to the children of Heth, saying: I am a stranger and sojourner among you: give me the right of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead.
Cumque surrexisset ab officio funeris, locutus est ad filios Heth dicens: “Advena sum et inquilinus apud vos; date mihi possessionem sepulcri vobiscum, ut sepeliam mortuum meum”.
The children of Heth answered, saying: My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God among us: bury thy dead in our principal sepulchres: and no man shall have power to hinder thee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre.
Responderunt filii Heth dicentes: Audi nos, domine, princeps Dei es apud nos: in nobilissimo sepulcrorum nostrorum sepeli mortuum tuum; nullusque te prohibebit, quin in sepulcro eius sepelias mortuum tuum.
Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, to wit, the children of Heth: And said to them: If it please your soul that I should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede for me to Ephron the son of Seor. That he may give me the double cave, which he hath in the end of his field: For as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before you, for a possession of a burying place.
Surrexit Abraham et adoravit populum terræ, filios videlicet Heth, dixitque ad eos: Si placet animæ vestræ, ut sepeliam mortuum meum, audite me et intercedite pro me apud Ephron filium Seor, ut det mihi speluncam Machpela, quam habet in extrema parte agri sui. Pecunia digna tradat eam mihi coram vobis in possessionem sepulcri.
Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city, saying: Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou rather hearken to what I say: The field I deliver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the presence of the children of my people, bury thy dead.
Sedebat autem Ephron in medio filiorum Heth. Responditque Ephron Hetthæus ad Abraham, filiis Heth audientibus cunctis, qui ingrediebantur portam civitatis illius, dicens: Nequaquam ita fiat, domine mi, ausculta me. Agrum do tibi et speluncam, quæ in eo est, præsentibus filiis populi mei; sepeli mortuum tuum.
Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will give money for the field; take it, and so will I bury my dead in it.
Adoravit Abraham coram populo terræ et locutus est ad Ephron, audiente populo terræ: Quæso, ut audias me. Dabo pecuniam pro agro; suscipe eam, et sic sepeliam mortuum meum in eo.
And Ephron answered: My lord, hear me. The ground which thou desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but what is this? bury thy dead.
Respondit Ephron ad Abraham dicens ei: Domine mi, audi me. Terra quadringentorum siclorum argenti inter me et te quid est hoc? Sepeli mortuum tuum.
And when Abraham had heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred sicles of silver, of common current money.
Auscultavit Abraham Ephron et appendit pecuniam, quam Ephron postulaverat, audientibus filiis Heth, quadringentos siclos argenti, sicut mos erat apud negotiatores.
And the field that before was Ephron's, wherein was the double cave, looking towards Mambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees thereof, in all its limits round about, was made sure to Abraham for a possession, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of all that went in at the gate of his city.
Confirmatusque est ager Ephronis, qui erat in Machpela respiciens Mambre, tam ipse quam spelunca in eo et omnes arbores eius in cunctis terminis eius per circuitum, Abrahæ in possessionem, videntibus filiis Heth cunctis, qui intrabant portam civitatis illius.
And so Abraham buried Sara, his wife, in the double cave of the field, that looked towards Mambre, this is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
Deinde sepelivit Abraham Saram uxorem suam in spelunca agri Machpela, qui respiciebat Mambre hæc est Hebron­ in terra Chanaan.
And the field was made sure to Abraham, and the cave that was in it, for a possession to bury in, by the children of Heth.
Et confirmatus est ager et antrum, quod erat in eo, Abrahae in possessionem sepulcri a filiis Heth.
Now Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed him in all things.
Erat autem Abraham senex dierumque multorum; et Dominus in cunctis benedixerat ei.
And he said to the elder servant of his house, who was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand under my thigh, that I may make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, that thou take not a wife for my son, of the daughters of the Chanaanites, among whom I dwell: but that thou go to my own country and kindred, and take a wife from thence for my son Isaac.
Dixitque Abraham ad servum seniorem domus suæ, qui præerat omnibus, quæ habebat: Pone manum tuam subter femur meum, ut adiurem te per Dominum, Deum cæli et Deum terræ, ut non accipias uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chananæorum, inter quos habito; sed ad terram et cognationem meam proficiscaris et inde accipias uxorem filio meo Isaac.
The servant answered: If the woman will not come with me into this land, must I bring thy son back again to the place from whence thou camest out?
Respondit servus: Si noluerit mulier venire mecum in terram hanc, num reducere debeo filium tuum ad terram, a quo tu egressus es?
And Abraham said: Beware thou never bring my son back again thither.
Dixit Abraham: Cave, ne quando reducas illuc filium meum.
The Lord God of heaven, who took me out of my father's house, and out of my native country, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying: To thy seed will I give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son.
Dominus, Deus cæli, qui tulit me de domo patris mei et de terra nativitatis meæ, qui locutus est mihi et iuravit mihi dicens: "Semini tuo dabo terram hanc", ipse mittet angelum suum coram te, et accipies inde uxorem filio meo.
But if the woman will not follow thee, thou shalt not be bound by the oath: only bring not my son back thither again.
Sin autem noluerit mulier sequi te, non teneberis iuramento; filium tantum meum ne reducas illuc.
The servant, therefore, put his hand under the thigh of Abraham, his lord, and swore to him upon his word.
Posuit ergo servus manum sub femore Abraham domini sui et iuravit illi super hac re.
And he took ten camels of his master's herd, and departed, carrying something of all his goods with him, and he set forward and went on to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.
Tulitque servus decem camelos de grege domini sui et abiit ex omnibus bonis eius portans secum; profectusque perrexit in Aram Naharaim ad urbem Nachor.
And when he had made the camels lie down without the town, near a well of water, in the evening, at the time when women are wont to come out to draw water, he said: O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham, meet me today, I beseech thee, and shew kindness to my master, Abraham.
Cumque camelos fecisset accumbere extra oppidum iuxta puteum aquæ vespere, tempore quo solent mulieres egredi ad hauriendam aquam, dixit: Domine, Deus domini mei Abraham, occurre obsecro mihi hodie et fac misericordiam cum domino meo Abraham.
Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water, and the daughters of the inhabitants of this city will come out to draw water.
Ecce ego sto prope fontem aquæ, et filiæ habitatorum huius civitatis egredientur ad hauriendam aquam.
Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall say: Let down thy pitcher that I may drink: and she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let it be the same whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this, I shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness to my master.
Igitur puella, cui ego dixero: "Inclina hydriam tuam, ut bibam", et illa responderit: "Bibe, quin et camelis tuis dabo potum", ipsa est, quam præparasti servo tuo Isaac, et per hoc intellegam quod feceris misericordiam cum domino meo.
He had not yet ended these words within himself, and behold Rebecca came out, the daughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to Nachor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher on her shoulder.
Necdum intra se verba compleverat, et ecce Rebecca egrediebatur filia Bathuel filii Melchæ uxoris Nachor fratris Abraham habens hydriam in scapula.
An exceeding comely maid, and a most beautiful virgin, and not known to man: and she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher, and was coming back.
Puella decora nimis, virgo et incognita viro. Descendit ad fontem et implevit hydriam ac revertebatur.
And the servant ran to meet her, and said: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher.
Occurritque ei servus et ait: Pauxillum mihi ad sorbendum præbe aquæ de hydria tua.
And she answered: Drink, my lord. And quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him drink.
Quæ respondit: “Bibe, domine mi”. Celeriterque deposuit hydriam super ulnam suam et dedit ei potum.
And when he had drunk, she said: I will draw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.
Cumque ille bibisset, adiecit: Quin et camelis tuis hauriam aquam, donec cuncti bibant.
And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs, she ran back to the well to draw water; and having drawn, she gave to all the camels.
Effundensque hydriam in canalibus recurrit ad puteum, ut hauriret aquam; et haustam omnibus camelis dedit.
But he musing, beheld her with silence, desirous to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.
Ille autem contemplabatur eam tacitus, scire volens utrum prosperum fecisset iter suum Dominus an non.
And after that the camels had drunk, the man took out golden earrings, weighing two sicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight. And he said to her: Whose daughter art thou? tell me: is there any place in thy father's house to lodge?
Postquam ergo biberunt cameli, protulit vir anulum aureum pondo dimidii sicli pro naribus et duas armillas pro manibus eius pondo siclorum decem; dixitque: Cuius es filia? lndica mihi. Est in domo patris tui locus nobis ad pernoctandum?
And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.
Quæ respondit: Filia Bathuelis sum filii Melchæ, quem peperit Nachor.
And she said, moreover, to him: We have good store of both straw and hay, and a large place to lodge in.
Et addidit dicens: Palearum quoque et pabuli plurimum est apud nos et locus ad pernoctandum.
The man bowed himself down, and adored the Lord, saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not taken away his mercy and truth from my master, and hath brought me the straight way into the house of my master's brother.
Inclinavit se homo et adoravit Dominum dicens: Benedictus Dominus, Deus domini mei Abraham, qui non abstulit misericordiam et veritatem suam a domino meo et recto itinere me perduxit in domum fratris domini mei.
Then the maid ran, and told in her mother's house all that she had heard.
Cucurrit itaque puella et nuntiavit in domum matris suæ omnia, quæ evenerant.
And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban, who went out in haste to the man, to the well. And when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in his sister's hands, and had heard all that she related, saying, Thus and thus the man spoke to me: he came to the man who stood by the camels, and near to the spring of water, and said to him: Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; why standest thou without? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.
Habebat autem Rebecca fratrem nomine Laban, qui festinus egressus est ad hominem, ubi erat fons. Cumque vidisset anulum in naribus et armillas in manibus sororis suæ et audisset cuncta verba referentis: “Hæc locutus est mihi homo”, venit ad virum, qui stabat iuxta camelos et prope fontem aquæ; dixitque ad eum: “Ingredere, benedicte Domini, cur foris stas? Præparavi domum et locum camelis”.
And he brought him into his lodging; and he unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and hay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were come with him.
Et introduxit eum in hospitium ac destravit camelos; deditque paleas et pabulum camelis et aquam ad lavandos pedes eius et virorum, qui venerant cum eo.
And bread was set before him. But he said: I will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered him: Speak.
Et apposuit in conspectu eius panem. Qui ait: "Non comedam, donec loquar sermones meos”. Respondit: “Loquere”.
And he said: I am the servant of Abraham. And the Lord hath blessed my master wonderfully, and he is become great: and he hath given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men servants and women servants, camels and asses.
At ille: Servus, inquit, Abraham sum; et Dominus benedixit domino meo valde, magnificatusque est; et dedit ei oves et boves, argentum et aurum, servos et ancillas, camelos et asinos.
And Sara, my master's wife, hath borne my master a son in her old age, and he hath given him all that he had.
Et peperit Sara uxor domini mei filium domino meo in senectute sua; deditque illi omnia, quæ habuerat.
And my master made me swear, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the Chanaanites, in whose land I dwell: but thou shalt go to my father's house, and shalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son.
Et adiuravit me dominus meus dicens: Non accipies uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chananæorum, in quorum terra habito; sed ad domum patris mei perges et de cognatione mea accipies uxorem filio meo.
But I answered my master: What if the woman will not come with me?
Ego vero respondi domino meo: Quid, si noluerit venire mecum mulier?
The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk, will send his angel with thee, and will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my own kindred, and of my father's house. But thou shalt be clear from my curse, when thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will not give thee one.
Dominus, ait, in cuius conspectu ambulo, mittet angelum suum tecum et diriget viam tuam; accipiesque uxorem filio meo de cognatione mea et de domo patris mei. Innocens eris a maledictione mea, cum veneris ad propinquos meos, et non dederint tibi; tunc innocens eris a maledictione mea.
And I came today to the well of water, and said: O Lord God of my master, Abraham, if thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now walk, behold, I stand by the well of water, and the virgin, that shall come out to draw water, who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher: and shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for my master's son.
Veni ergo hodie ad fontem et dixi: Domine, Deus domini mei Abraham, si direxisti viam meam, in qua nunc ambulo, ecce sto iuxta fontem aquæ; et virgo, quæ egredietur ad hauriendam aquam, audierit a me: "Da mihi pauxillum aquæ ad bibendum ex hydria tua"; et dixerit mihi: "Et tu bibe, et camelis tuis hauriam", ipsa est mulier, quam præparavit Dominus filio domini mei.
And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her: Give me a little to drink.
Dum hæc tacitus mecum volverem, apparuit Rebecca veniens cum hydria, quam portabat in scapula; descenditque ad fontem et hausit aquam. Et aio ad eam: Da mihi paululum bibere.
And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou, and to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and she watered the camels.
Quæ festina deposuit hydriam de umero et dixit mihi: "Et tu bibe, et camelis tuis potum tribuam". Bibi, et adaquavit camelos.
And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn her face, and I put bracelets on her hands.
Interrogavique eam et dixi: Cuius es filia? Quæ respondit: "Filia Bathuelis sum filii Nachor, quem peperit illi Melcha". Suspendi itaque anulum in naribus eius et armillas posui in manibus eius.
Wherefore, if you do according to mercy and truth with my master, tell me: but if it please you otherwise, tell me that also, that I may go to the right hand, or to the left.
Quam ob rem, si facitis misericordiam et veritatem cum domino meo, indicate mihi; sin autem aliud placet, et hoc dicite mihi, ut vadam ad dexteram sive ad sinistram.
And falling down, I adored the Lord, blessing the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
Pronusque adoravi Dominum benedicens Domino, Deo domini mei Abraham, qui perduxit me recto itinere, ut sumerem filiam fratris domini mei filio eius.
And Laban and Bathuel answered: The word hath proceeded from the Lord: we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.
Responderunt Laban et Bathuel: A Domino egressus est sermo; non possumus extra placitum eius quidquam aliud loqui tecum.
Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy master's son, as the Lord hath spoken.
En Rebecca coram te est; tolle eam et proficiscere, et sit uxor filii domini tui, sicut locutus est Dominus.
Which when Abraham's servant heard, falling down to the ground, he adored the Lord.
Quod cum audisset puer Abraham, procidens adoravit in terram Dominum.
And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca, for a present. He offered gifts also to her brothers, and to her mother.
Prolatisque vasis argenteis et aureis ac vestibus, dedit ea Rebeccæ; res pretiosas dedit fratri eius et matri.
And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank together, and lodged there. And in the morning, the servant arose, and said: Let me depart, that I may go to my master.
Tunc comederunt et biberunt ipse et viri, qui erant cum eo, et pernoctaverunt ibi. Surgens autem mane locutus est puer: Dimittite me, ut vadam ad dominum meum.
And her brother and mother answered: Let the maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and afterwards she shall depart.
Responderuntque frater eius et mater: Maneat puella saltem decem dies apud nos et postea proficiscetur.
Stay me not, said he, because the Lord hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.
Nolite, ait, me retinere, quia Dominus direxit viam meam; dimittite me, ut pergam ad dominum meum.
And they said: Let us call the maid, and ask her will.
Dixerunt: Vocemus puellam et quæramus ipsius voluntatem.
And they called her, and when she was come, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man? She said: I will go.
Cumque vocata venisset, sciscitati sunt: “Vis ire cum homine isto?” Quæ ait: "Vadam".
So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, servant, and his company, wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands; and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies.
Dimiserunt ergo Rebeccam sororem eorum et nutricem illius servumque Abraham et comites eius, imprecantes prospera sorori suæ atque dicentes: Soror nostra es, crescas in mille milia, et possideat semen tuum portas inimicorum suorum!
So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the man: who with speed returned to his master.
Igitur surrexit Rebecca et puellæ illius et, ascensis camelis, secutæ sunt virum; sumpsitque servus Rebeccam et abiit.
At the same time, Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country.
Isaac autem venerat a regione putei Lahairoi et habitabat in terra Nageb.
And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day being now well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming afar off.
Et egressus est Isaac ad lamentandum in agro, inclinata iam die. Cumque levasset oculos, vidit camelos venientes.
Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel, and said to the servant: Who is that man who cometh towards us along the field? And he said to her: That man is my master. But she quickly took her cloak, and covered herself.
Rebecca quoque levavit oculos et vidit Isaac; descenditque de camelo et ait ad puerum: “Quis est ille homo, qui venit per agrum in occursum nobis?” Dixitque ei: “Ipse est dominus meus”. At illa tollens cito velum operuit se.
And the servant told Isaac all that he had done, who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, and took her to wife: and he loved her so much, that it moderated the sorrow which was occasioned by his mother's death.
Servus autem cuncta, quæ gesserat, narravit Isaac; qui introduxit eam in tabernaculum Saræ matris suæ et accepit Rebeccam uxorem; et dilexit eam et consolatus est a morte matris suæ.
And the days of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five years.
Fuerunt autem dies vitæ Abrahæ centum septuaginta quinque anni.
And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to his people.
Et deficiens mortuus est Abraham in senectute bona provectæque ætatis et plenus dierum congregatusque est ad populum suum.
And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre, which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.
Et sepelierunt eum Isaac et Ismael filii sui in spelunca Machpela, quæ sita est in agro Ephron filii Seor Hetthæi e regione Mambre, quem emerat a filiis Heth. Ibi sepultus est ipse et Sara uxor eius.
And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.
Et post obitum illius benedixit Deus Isaac filio eius, qui habitabat iuxta puteum Lahairoi.
And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.
Deprecatusque est Isaac Dominum pro uxore sua, eo quod esset sterilis. Qui exaudivit eum et dedit conceptum Rebeccæ.
But the children struggled in her womb, and she said: If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult the Lord.
Sed collidebantur in utero eius parvuli. Quæ ait: “Si sic est, cur mihi?” Perrexitque, ut consuleret Dominum.
And he answering, said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.
Qui respondens ait: Duæ gentes sunt in utero tuo, et duo populi ex ventre tuo dividentur; populusque populum superabit, et maior serviet minori.
And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.
Iam tempus pariendi venerat, et ecce gemini in utero eius.
He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau.
Qui primus egressus est rufus erat et totus quasi pallium pilosum; vocatumque est nomen eius Esau.
Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother's foot in his hand: and therefore he was called Jacob.
Postea frater eius egrediens plantam Esau tenebat manu, et idcirco appellatum est nomen eius Iacob.
Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him.
Sexagenarius erat Isaac, quando nati sunt parvuli.
And when they were grown up, Esau became a skilful hunter, and a husbandman: but Jacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.
Quibus adultis, factus est Esau vir gnarus venandi et homo agrestis; Iacob autem vir compositus et habitans in tabernaculis.
Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.
Isaac amabat Esau, eo quod de venationibus illius libenter vesceretur; et Rebecca diligebat Iacob.
And Jacob boiled pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field, said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his name was called Edom.
Coxit autem Iacob pulmentum; ad quem, cum venisset Esau de agro lassus, ait: “Da mihi de coctione hac rufa, quia oppido lassus sum”. Quam ob causam vocatum est nomen eius Edom (id est Rufus).
And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first birthright.
Cui dixit Iacob: Vende mihi prius primogenita tua.
He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me?
Ille respondit: En morior; quid mihi proderunt primogenita?
Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright.
Ait Iacob: “Iura ergo mihi”. Iuravit et vendidit primogenita.
And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright.
Et sic, accepto pane et lentis edulio, comedit et bibit; surrexit et abiit parvipendens quod primogenita vendidisset.
And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Palestines, to Gerara.
Orta autem fame super terram post eam sterilitatem, quæ acciderat in diebus Abraham, abiit Isaac ad Abimelech regem Philisthim in Gerara.
And the Lord appeared to him, and said: Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee.
Apparuitque ei Dominus et ait: Ne descendas in Aegyptum, sed habita in terra, quam dixero tibi.
And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfil the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father.
Et peregrinare in ea; eroque tecum et benedicam tibi. Tibi enim et semini tuo dabo universas regiones has complens iuramentum, quod spopondi Abraham patri tuo.
And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws.
Et multiplicabo semen tuum sicut stellas cæli daboque posteris tuis universas regiones has; et benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terræ, eo quod obœdierit Abraham voci meæ et custodierit præcepta et mandata mea et iustificationes legesque servaverit.
So Isaac abode in Gerara.
Mansit itaque Isaac in Geraris.
And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister: for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of her beauty.
Qui, cum interrogaretur a viris loci illius super uxore sua, respondit: “Soror mea est”. Timuerat enim confiteri quod sibi esset sociata coniugio, reputans ne forte interficerent eum propter illius pulchritudinem.
And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech, king of the Palestines, looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca, his wife.
Cumque pertransissent dies plurimi et ibidem moraretur, prospiciens Abimelech rex Philisthim per fenestram vidit eum iocantem cum Rebecca uxore sua.
And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake.
Et, accersito eo, ait: “Perspicuum est quod uxor tua sit; cur mentitus es eam sororem tuam esse?” Respondit: “Timui, ne morerer propter eam”.
And Abimelech said: Why hast thou deceived us? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin.
Dixitque Abimelech: Quare hoc fecisti nobis? Potuit coire quispiam de populo cum uxore tua, et induxeras super nos grande peccatum.
And he commanded all the people, saying: He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death.
Præcepitque omni populo dicens: Qui tetigerit hominem hunc et uxorem eius, morte morietur.
And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.
Sevit autem Isaac in terra illa et invenit in ipso anno centuplum; benedixitque ei Dominus.
And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great.
Et locupletatus est homo et ibat proficiens atque succrescens, donec magnus vehementer effectus est.
And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family.
Habuitque possessionem ovium et armentorum et familiæ plurimum.
Wherefore the Palestines envying him, stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father, Abraham, had digged, filling them up with Earth.
Ob hæc invidentes ei Philisthim omnes puteos, quos foderant servi patris illius in diebus Abraham, obstruxerunt implentes humo.
Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.
In tantum ut ipse Abimelech diceret ad Isaac: Recede a nobis, quoniam potentior nostri factus es valde.
So he departed, and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there.
Et ille discedens tentoria fixit ad torrentem Geraræ habitavitque ibi.
And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father, Abraham, had digged, and which, after his death, the Philistines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names, by which his father before had called them.
Rursum fodit puteos, quos foderant in diebus patris sui Abraham et quos, illo mortuo, obstruxerant Philisthim. Appellavitque eos eisdem nominibus, quibus ante pater vocaverat.
And they digged in the torrent, and found living water.
Foderunt servi Isaac in torrente et reppererunt ibi puteum aquæ vivæ.
But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.
Sed et ibi iurgium fuit pastorum Geraræ adversus pastores Isaac dicentium: “Nostra est aqua!” Quam ob rem nomen putei vocavit Esec (id est Iurgium), quia iurgati sunt cum eo.
And they digged also another; and for that they quarrelled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity.
Foderunt autem et alium puteum, et pro illo quoque rixati sunt; appellavitque eum Sitna (id est Inimicitias).
Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not; therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth.
Profectus inde fodit alium puteum, pro quo non contenderunt; itaque vocavit nomen eius Rehoboth (id est Latitudinem) dicens: Nunc dilatavit nos Dominus, et crescemus in terra.
And he went up from that place to Bersabee, where the Lord appeared to him that same night, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father, do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
Ascendit autem ex illo loco in Bersabee, ubi apparuit ei Dominus in ipsa nocte dicens: Ego sum Deus Abraham patris tui. Noli timere, quia tecum sum; benedicam tibi et multiplicabo semen tuum propter servum meum Abraham.
And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a well.
Itaque ædificavit ibi altare et, invocato nomine Domini, extendit tabernaculum, et servi Isaac foderunt ibi puteum.
To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers, came from Gerara, Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out from you?
Abimelech autem venit ad eum de Geraris et Ochozath amicus illius et Phicol dux militum, et locutus est eis Isaac: Quid venistis ad me hominem, quem odistis et expulistis a vobis?
And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant, that thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee away, increased with the blessing of the Lord.
Qui responderunt: Vidimus tecum esse Dominum et idcirco diximus: Sit iuramentum inter nos et te, et ineamus tecum fœdus, ut non facias nobis quidquam mali, sicut et nos non attigimus te et nihil fecimus tibi nisi bonum et cum pace dimisimus te. Tu es enim benedictus Domini.
And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk.
Fecit ergo eis convivium, et comederunt et biberunt.
Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home.
Surgentesque mane iuraverunt sibi mutuo. Dimisitque eos Isaac, et profecti sunt ab eo cum pace.
And behold, the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying: We have found water.
Ecce autem venerunt in ipso die servi Isaac annuntiantes ei de puteo, quem foderant, atque dicentes: Invenimus aquam.
Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the city was called Bersabee, even to this day.
Unde appellavit eum Sabee (quod significat Abundantiam); et nomen urbi impositum est Bersabee usque in præsentem diem.
And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hethite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same place.
Esau vero quadragenarius duxit uxores Iudith filiam Beeri Hetthæi et Basemath filiam Elon Hetthæi.
And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca.
Quæ ambæ offenderant animum Isaac et Rebeccæ.
Now Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and he could not see: and he called Esau, his elder son, and said to him: My son? And he answered: Here I am.
Senuit autem Isaac, et caligaverunt oculi eius, et videre non poterat. Vocavitque Esau filium suum maiorem et dixit ei: “Fili mi”. Qui respondit: “Adsum”.
And his father said to him, Thou seest that I am old, and know not the day of my death. Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go abroad; and when thou hast taken something by hunting, make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou knowest I like, and bring it that I may eat: and my soul may bless thee, before I die.
Cui pater: Vides, inquit, quod senuerim et ignorem diem mortis meæ; sume arma tua, pharetram et arcum, et egredere in agrum. Cumque venatu aliquid apprehenderis, fac mihi inde pulmentum, sicut velle me nosti, et affer, ut comedam; et benedicat tibi anima mea, antequam moriar.
And when Rebecca had heard this, and he was gone into the field to fulfil his father's commandment,
Rebecca autem audierat Isaac loquentem cum Esau filio suo. Esau ergo abiit in agrum, ut venationem caperet et offerret eam.
She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father talking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to him: Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats that I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the Lord, before I die.
Rebecca autem dixit filio suo Iacob: Ecce, audivi patrem tuum loquentem cum Esau fratre tuo et dicentem ei: "Affer mihi venationem tuam et fac cibos, ut comedam et benedicam tibi coram Domino, antequam moriar".
Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel: And go thy way to the flock, bring me two kids of the best, that I may make of them meat for thy father, such as he gladly eateth. Which when thou hast brought in, and he hath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.
Nunc ergo, fili mi, audi vocem meam in eo, quod præcipio tibi. Pergens ad gregem affer mihi duos hædos optimos, ut faciam ex eis escas patri tuo, quibus libenter vescitur. Quas cum intuleris patri tuo, et comederit, benedicat tibi, priusquam moriatur.
And he answered her: Thou knowest that Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am smooth: if my father should feel me, and perceive it, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked him, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead of a blessing.
Cui ille respondit: Nosti quod Esau frater meus homo pilosus sit, et ego lenis. Si attrectaverit me pater meus et senserit, timeo, ne putet me sibi voluisse illudere; et inducam super me maledictionem pro benedictione.
And his mother said to him: Upon me be this curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and go, fetch me the things which I have said.
Ad quem mater: In me sit, ait, ista maledictio, fili mi; tantum audi vocem meam et perge afferque, quæ dixi.
He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew his father liked.
Abiit et attulit deditque matri. Paravit illa cibos, sicut noverat velle patrem illius.
And she put on him very good garments of Esau, which she had at home with her: and the little skins of the kids she put about his hands, and covered the bare of his neck.
Et vestibus Esau valde bonis, quas apud se habebat domi, induit eum pelliculasque hædorum circumdedit manibus et colli nuda protexit.
And she gave him the savoury meat, and delivered him bread that she had baked.
Dedit pulmentum optimum et panes, quos coxerat, in manus filii sui Iacob.
Which when he had carried in, he said: My father? But he answered: I hear. Who art thou, my son?
Qui ingressus ad patrem suum dixit: “Pater mi”. At ille respondit: “Audio. Quis es tu, fili mi?”
And Jacob said: I am Esau, thy firstborn: I have done as thou didst command me: arise, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Dixitque Iacob ad patrem suum: Ego sum Esau primogenitus tuus. Feci sicut præcepisti mihi; surge, sede et comede de venatione mea, ut benedicat mihi anima tua.
And Isaac said to his son: How couldst thou find it so quickly, my son? He answered: It was the will of God, that what I sought came quickly in my way.
Rursum Isaac ad filium suum: "Quomodo, inquit, tam cito invenire potuisti, fili mi?" Qui respondit: “Voluntas Domini Dei tui fuit, ut occurreret mihi”.
And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may feel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou be my son Esau, or no.
Dixitque Isaac ad Iacob: Accede huc, ut tangam te, fili mi, et probem, utrum tu sis filius meus Esau an non.
He came near to his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of Esau.
Accessit ille ad patrem, et, palpato eo, dixit Isaac: Vox quidem, vox Iacob est, sed manus, manus sunt Esau.
He said: Art thou my son Esau? He answered: I am.
Ait: “Tu es filius meus Esau?” Respondit: “Ego sum”.
Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy hunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee. And when they were brought, and he had eaten, he offered him wine also, which after he had drunk, he said to him: Come near me, and give me a kiss, my son.
At ille: “Affer, inquit, mihi, et comedam de venatione tua, fili mi, ut benedicat tibi anima mea”. Quos cum oblatos comedisset, obtulit ei etiam vinum. Quo hausto, dixit ad eum Isaac pater eius: “Accede ad me et da mihi osculum, fili mi”.
He came near, and kissed him. And immediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of his garments, blessing him, he said: Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field, which the Lord hath blessed.
Accessit et osculatus est eum. Statimque, ut sensit vestimentorum illius fragrantiam, benedicens illi ait: Ecce odor filii mei sicut odor agri pleni, cui benedixit Dominus.
God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and wine.
Det tibi Deus de rore cæli et de pinguedine terræ et abundantiam frumenti et vini.
And let peoples serve thee, and tribes worship thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and let thy mother's children bow down before thee. Cursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that blesseth thee be filled with blessings.
Et serviant tibi populi, et adorent te nationes; esto dominus fratrum tuorum, et incurventur ante te filii matris tuæ. Qui maledixerit tibi, sit maledictus; et, qui benedixerit tibi, sit benedictus!
Isaac had scarce ended his words, when, Jacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came, and brought in to his father meats, made of what he had taken in hunting, saying: Arise, my father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy soul may bless me.
Vix Isaac benedictionem Iacob finierat, et Iacob egressus erat a patre suo Isaac, venit Esau frater eius coctosque de venatione cibos intulit patri dicens: Surge, pater mi, et comede de venatione filii tui, ut benedicat mihi anima tua.
And Isaac said to him: Why! who art thou? He answered: I am thy firstborn son, Esau.
Dixitque illi Isaac pater eius: “Quis enim es tu?” Qui respondit: “Ego sum filius tuus primogenitus Esau”.
Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished exceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be believed, said: Who is he then that even now brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate of all before thou camest? and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.
Expavit Isaac stupore vehementi ultra modum et ait: Quis igitur ille est, qui dudum captam venationem attulit mihi, et comedi ex omnibus, priusquam tu venires? Benedixique ei, et erit benedictus!
Esau having heard his father's words, roared out with a great cry; and, being in a consternation, said: Bless me also, my father.
Auditis Esau sermonibus patris, irrugiit clamore magno et amaro ultra modum et ait patri suo: Benedic etiam mihi, pater mi!
And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing.
Qui ait: Venit germanus tuus fraudulenter et accepit benedictionem tuam.
But he said again: Rightly is his name called Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this second time: My birthright he took away before, and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing. And again he said to his father: Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?
At ille subiunxit: “Iuste vocatum est nomen eius Iacob; supplantavit enim me en altera vice: primogenita mea ante tulit et nunc secundo surripuit benedictionem meam”. Rursumque ait: “Numquid non reservasti mihi benedictionem?”
Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants: I have established him with corn and wine, and after this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?
Respondit Isaac: Ecce, dominum tuum illum constitui et omnes fratres eius servituti illius subiugavi; frumento et vino stabilivi eum. Et tibi post hæc, fili mi, ultra quid faciam?
And Esau said to him: Hast thou only one blessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also.
Dixitque Esau ad patrem suum: Num unam tantum benedictionem habes, pater mi? Mihi quoque obsecro, ut benedicas!
And when he wept with a loud cry, Isaac being moved, said to him: In the fat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from above, shall thy blessing be.
Cumque eiulatu magno fleret, motus Isaac dixit ad eum: Ecce, procul a pinguedine terræ erit habitatio tua et procul a rore cæli desuper.
Thou shalt live by the sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.
De gladio tuo vives et fratri tuo servies. Tempusque veniet, cum excutias et solvas iugum eius de cervicibus tuis.
Esau therefore always hated Jacob, for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him; and he said in his heart: The days will come of the mourning for my father, and I will kill my brother Jacob.
Oderat ergo Esau Iacob pro benedictione, qua benedixerat ei pater, dixitque in corde suo: Appropinquabunt dies luctus patris mei, et occidam Iacob fratrem meum.
These things were told to Rebecca: and she sent and called Jacob, her son, and said to him: Behold Esau, thy brother, threateneth to kill thee.
Nuntiata sunt Rebeccæ verba Esau filii eius maioris, quæ mittens et vocans Iacob filium suum minorem dixit ad eum: Ecce, Esau frater tuus minatur, ut occidat te.
Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise and flee to Laban, my brother, to Haran: And thou shalt dwell with him a few days, till the wrath of thy brother be assuaged, and his indignation cease, and he forget the things thou hast done to him.
Nunc ergo, fili mi, audi vocem meam et consurgens fuge ad Laban fratrem meum in Charran; habitabisque cum eo dies paucos, donec requiescat furor fratris tui, et cesset indignatio eius, obliviscaturque eorum, quæ fecisti in eum.
Afterwards I will send, and bring thee from thence hither. Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one day?
Postea mittam et adducam te inde huc. Cur utroque orbabor filio in uno die?
And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I choose not to live.
Dixit quoque Rebecca ad Isaac: Tædet me vitæ meæ propter filias Heth; si acceperit Iacob uxorem de filiabus Heth sicut istis de filiabus terræ, nolo vivere.
And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock of Canaan, but go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia of Syria, to the house of Bathuel, thy mother's father, and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban, thy uncle.
Vocavit itaque Isaac Iacob et benedixit eum præcepitque ei dicens: Noli accipere coniugem de filiabus Chanaan; surge, vade in Paddanaram ad domum Bathuel patris matris tuæ et accipe tibi inde uxorem de filiabus Laban avunculi tui.
And God almighty bless thee, and make thee to increase and multiply thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of people.
Deus autem omnipotens benedicat tibi et crescere te faciat atque multiplicet, ut sis in multitudinem populorum.
And give the blessings of Araham to thee, and to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy sojournment, which he promised to thy grandfather.
Et det tibi benedictiones Abraham tibi et semini tuo tecum, ut possideas terram peregrinationis tuæ, quam pollicitus est Deus avo tuo.
And when Isaac had sent him away, he took his journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria, to Laban, the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, brother to Rebecca, his mother.
Cumque dimisisset eum Isaac, profectus est in Paddanaram ad Laban filium Bathuel Aramæi fratrem Rebeccæ matris Iacob et Esau.
And Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the blessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan: and that Jacob obeying his parents, was gone into Syria: experiencing also, that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of Canaan:
Videns autem Esau quod benedixisset pater suus Iacob et misisset eum in Paddanaram, ut inde uxorem duceret, et quod post benedictionem præcepisset ei dicens: “Non accipies uxorem de filiabus Chanaan”, quodque obœdiens Iacob parentibus suis isset in Paddanaram; probans quoque quod non libenter aspiceret filias Chanaan pater suus.
He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides them he had before, Maheleth, the daughter of Ismael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nabajoth.
Ivit ad Ismaelem et duxit uxorem, absque iis, quas habebat, Mahalath filiam Ismael filii Abraham sororem Nabaioth.
But Jacob being departed from Bersabee, went on to Haran.
Igitur egressus Iacob de Bersabee pergebat Charran.
And when he was come to a certain place, and would rest in it after sunset, he took of the stones that lay there, and putting under his head, slept in the same place.
Cumque venisset ad quendam locum et vellet in eo requiescere post solis occubitum, tulit de lapidibus, qui iacebant, et supponens capiti suo dormivit in eodem loco.
And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth, and the top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of God ascending and descending by it, and the Lord leaning upon the ladder saying to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac:
Viditque in somnio scalam stantem super terram et cacumen illius tangens cælum, angelos quoque Dei ascendentes et descendentes per eam et Dominum innixum scalæ dicentem sibi: Ego sum Dominus, Deus Abraham patris tui et Deus Isaac.
The land, wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and thy seed, all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.
Terram, in qua dormis, tibi dabo et semini tuo. Eritque semen tuum quasi pulvis terræ; dilataberis ad occidentem et orientem et septentrionem et meridiem; et benedicentur in te et in semine tuo cunctæ tribus terræ.
And I will be thy keeper whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have accomplished all that I have said.
Et ecce, ego tecum sum et custodiam te, quocumque perrexeris, et reducam te in terram hanc; nec dimittam te, nisi complevero quæ dixi tibi.
And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he said: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.
Cumque evigilasset Iacob de somno, ait: Vere Dominus est in loco isto, et ego nesciebam.
And trembling, he said: How terrible is this place? this is no other but the house of God, and the gate of heaven.
Pavensque: Quam terribilis est, inquit, locus iste! Non est hic aliud nisi domus Dei et porta cæli.
And Jacob arising in the morning, took the stone which he had laid under his head, and set it up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.
Surgens ergo Iacob mane tulit lapidem, quem supposuerat capiti suo, et erexit in titulum fundens oleum desuper.
And he called the name of the city Bethel, which before was called Luza.
Appellavitque nomen loci illius Bethel; prius autem urbs vocabatur Luza.
And he made a vow, saying: If God shall be with me, and shall keep me in the way, by which I walk, and shall give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, and I shall return prosperously to my father's house: the Lord shall be my God: and this stone, which I have set up for a title, shall be called the house of God: and of all things that thou shalt give to me, I will offer tithes to thee.
Vovit Iacob etiam votum dicens: Si fuerit Deus mecum et custodierit me in via hac, per quam ambulo, et dederit mihi panem ad vescendum et vestimentum ad induendum, reversusque fuero prospere ad domum patris mei, erit mihi Dominus in Deum, et lapis iste, quem erexi in titulum, erit domus Dei; cunctorumque, quæ dederis mihi, decimas offeram tibi.
Then Jacob went on in his journey, and came into the east country.
Profectus ergo Iacob venit in terram orientalium.
And he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were watered out of it, and the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone.
Et vidit puteum in agro, tres quoque greges ovium accubantes iuxta eum; nam ex illo adaquabantur pecora, et os eius grandi lapide claudebatur.
And the custom was, when all the sheep were gathered together, to roll away the stone, and after the sheep were watered, to put it on the mouth of the well again.
Morisque erat, ut, cunctis ovibus congregatis, devolverent lapidem et, refectis gregibus, rursum super os putei ponerent.
And he said to the shepherds: Brethren, whence are you? They answered: Of Haran.
Dixitque ad pastores: “Fratres, unde estis?” Qui responderunt: “De Charran”.
And he asked them, saying: Know you Laban, the son of Nachor? They said: We know him.
Quos interrogans: “Numquid, ait, nostis Laban filium Nachor?” Dixerunt: “Novimus”.
He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say they: and behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh with his flock.
“Sanusne est?”, inquit. “Valet, inquiunt, et ecce Rachel filia eius venit cum grege”.
And Jacob said: There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again: first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to feed.
Dixitque: Adhuc multum diei superest, nec est tempus, ut congregentur greges; date potum ovibus et sic ad pastum eas reducite.
They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle be gathered together, and we remove the stone from the well's mouth, that we may water the flocks.
Qui responderunt: Non possumus, donec omnia pecora congregentur et amoveamus lapidem de ore putei, ut adaquemus greges.
They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she fed the flock.
Adhuc loquebatur cum eis, et ecce Rachel veniebat cum ovibus patris sui; nam gregem ipsa pascebat.
And when Jacob saw her, and knew her to be his cousin german, and that they were the sheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed.
Cum vidisset Iacob Rachel filiam Laban avunculi sui ovesque Laban avunculi sui, accedens amovit lapidem de ore putei et adaquavit gregem Laban avunculi sui.
And having watered the flock, he kissed her: and lifting up his voice wept.
Tunc Iacob osculatus est Rachel et elevata voce flevit.
And he told her that he was her father's brother, and the son of Rebecca:
Et indicavit ei quod frater esset patris eius et filius Rebeccæ.
But she went in haste and told her father.
At illa festinans nuntiavit patri suo.
Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's son was come, ran forth to meet him: and embracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought him into his house.
Qui cum audisset venisse Iacob filium sororis suæ, cucurrit obviam ei; complexusque eum et in oscula ruens duxit in domum suam.
And when he had heard the causes of his journey, he answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh.
Auditis autem omnibus, quæ evenerant, respondit: Vere os meum es et caro mea!
And after the days of one month were expired, he said to him: Because thou art my brother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell me what wages thou wilt have.
Et, postquam Iacob habitavit apud eum per dies mensis unius, dixit ei Laban: Num, quia frater meus es, gratis servies mihi? Dic quid mercedis accipias.
Now he had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia; and the younger was called Rachel.
Habebat vero filias duas: nomen maioris Lia, minor vero appellabatur Rachel.
But Lia was blear-eyed: Rachel was well favoured, and of a beautiful countenance.
Sed Lia lippis erat oculis, Rachel decora et venusto aspectu.
And Jacob being in love with her, said: I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.
Quam diligens Iacob ait: Serviam tibi pro Rachel filia tua minore septem annis.
Laban answered: It is better that I give her to thee than to another man; stay with me.
Respondit Laban: Melius est, ut tibi eam dem quam alteri viro; mane apud me.
So Jacob served seven years for Rachel: and they seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his love.
Servivit igitur Iacob pro Rachel septem annis, et videbantur illi pauci dies præ amoris magnitudine.
And he said to Laban: Give me my wife; for now the time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
Dixitque ad Laban: Da mihi uxorem meam, quia iam tempus expletum est, ut ingrediar ad eam.
And he, having invited a great number of his friends to the feast, made the marriage.
Qui, vocatis omnibus viris loci ad convivium, fecit nuptias.
And at night he brought in Lia, his daughter, to him,
Et vespere sumpsit Liam filiam suam et introduxit ad eum, et venit ad eam.
Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom, when morning was come he saw it was Lia. And he said to his father-in-law: What is it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?
Facto mane, vidit, et ecce erat Lia. Et dixit ad socerum suum: Quid hoc fecisti mihi? Nonne pro Rachel servivi tibi? Quare imposuisti mihi?
Laban answered: It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in marriage first.
Respondit Laban: Non est in loco nostro consuetudinis, ut minorem ante maiorem tradamus ad nuptias.
Make up the week of days of this match: and I will give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.
Imple hebdomadam hanc, et alteram quoque dabo tibi pro opere, quo serviturus es mihi septem annis aliis.
He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past, he married Rachel, to whom her father gave Bala, for her servant.
Acquievit placito et, hebdomada transacta, dedit ei Laban filiam suam Rachel uxorem, cui servam Bilham tradidit.
And having at length obtained the marriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years.
Et ingressus etiam ad Rachel amavit eam plus quam Liam serviens apud eum septem annis aliis.
And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.
Videns autem Dominus quod despiceret Liam, aperuit vulvam eius, Rachel sterili permanente.
And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me.
Et concepit Lia et genuit filium vocavitque nomen eius Ruben dicens: Vidit Dominus humilitatem meam; nunc amabit me vir meus.
And again she conceived and bore a son, and said: Because the Lord heard that I was despised, he hath given this also to me: and she called his name Simeon.
Rursumque concepit et peperit filium et ait: “Quoniam audivit me Dominus haberi contemptui, dedit etiam istum mihi”; vocavitque nomen illius Simeon.
And she conceived the third time, and bore another son, and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called his name Levi.
Concepit tertio et genuit alium filium dixitque: “Nunc quoque copulabitur mihi maritus meus, eo quod pepererim ei tres filios”; et idcirco appellavit nomen eius Levi.
The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said: Now will I praise the Lord: and for this she called him Juda. And she left bearing.
Quarto concepit et peperit filium et ait: “Modo confitebor Domino”; et ob hoc vocavit eum Iudam. Cessavitque parere.
And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: he is Edom.
Habitavitque Esau in monte Seir. Ipse est Edom.
And Jacob dwelt in the land of Canaan, wherein his father sojourned.
Habitavit autem Iacob in terra Chanaan, in qua peregrinatus est pater suus.
Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.
Ioseph, cum decem et septem esset annorum, pascebat gregem cum fratribus suis adhuc puer; et erat cum filiis Bilhæ et Zelphæ uxorum patris sui; detulitque patri malam eorum famam.
Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.
Israel autem diligebat Ioseph super omnes filios suos, eo quod in senectute genuisset eum; fecitque ei tunicam talarem.
And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
Videntes autem fratres eius quod a patre plus cunctis filiis amaretur, oderant eum nec poterant ei quidquam pacifice loqui.
Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.
Accidit quoque ut visum somnium referret fratribus suis; quæ causa maioris odii seminarium fuit.
And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed. I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about bowed down before my sheaf.
Dixitque ad eos: Audite somnium meum, quod vidi. Putabam ligare nos manipulos in agro, et quasi consurgere manipulum meum et stare, vestrosque manipulos circumstantes adorare manipulum meum.
What's the name of that bird?
Quod est nomen illius avis?
His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.
Responderunt fratres eius: “Numquid rex noster eris? Aut subiciemur dicioni tuæ?” Hæc ergo causa somniorum atque sermonum, invidiæ et odii fomitem ministravit.
He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.
Aliud quoque vidit somnium, quod narrans fratribus ait: Vidi per somnium quasi solem et lunam et stellas undecim adorare me.
And when he had told this to his father, and brethren, his father rebuked him and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?
Quod cum patri suo et fratribus retulisset, increpavit eum pater suus et dixit: Quid sibi vult hoc somnium, quod vidisti? Num ego et mater tua et fratres tui adorabimus te proni in terram?
His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.
Invidebant igitur ei fratres sui; pater vero rem tacitus considerabat.
And when his brethren abode in Sechem, feeding their father's flocks, Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them.
Cumque fratres illius in pascendis gregibus patris morarentur in Sichem, dixit Israel ad Ioseph: Fratres tui pascunt oves in Sichimis; veni, mittam te ad eos.
And when he answered: I am ready:
Quo respondente: "Præsto sum”, ait ei.
He said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing.
Vade et vide, si cuncta prospera sint erga fratres tuos et pecora, et renuntia mihi quid agatur.
So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem: And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.
Missus de valle Hebron venit in Sichem; invenitque eum vir errantem in agro et interrogavit quid quæreret.
But he answered: I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed the flocks.
At ille respondit: Fratres meos quæro; indica mihi, ubi pascant greges.
And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.
Dixitque ei vir: "Recesserunt de loco isto; audivi autem eos dicentes: "Eamus in Dothain"." Perrexit ergo Ioseph post fratres suos et invenit eos in Dothain.
And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him.
Qui cum vidissent eum procul, antequam accederet ad eos, cogitaverunt illum occidere.
And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh. Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him.
Et mutuo loquebantur: Ecce somniator venit; venite, occidamus eum et mittamus in unam cisternarum dicemusque: Fera pessima devoravit eum. Et tunc apparebit quid illi prosint somnia sua.
And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said: Do not take away his life.
Audiens autem hoc Ruben nitebatur liberare eum de manibus eorum et dixit: Non interficiamus animam eius.
Nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.
Et dixit ad eos: "Non effundatis sanguinem; sed proicite eum in cisternam hanc, quæ est in solitudine, manusque vestras servate innoxias”. Hoc autem dicebat volens eripere eum de manibus eorum et reddere patri suo.
And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours: And cast him into an old pit where there was not water.
Confestim igitur, ut pervenit ad fratres suos, nudaverunt eum tunica talari miseruntque eum in cisternam, quæ non habebat aquam.
And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.
Et sederunt, ut comederent panem. Attollentes autem oculos viderunt Ismaelitas viatores venire de Galaad et camelos eorum portantes tragacanthum et masticem et ladanum in Aegyptum.
And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?
Dixit ergo Iudas fratribus suis: Quid nobis prodest, si occiderimus fratrem nostrum et celaverimus sanguinem ipsius?
It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.
"Melius est ut vendatur Ismaelitis, et manus nostræ non polluantur; frater enim et caro nostra est ”. Acquieverunt fratres sermonibus illius.
I'm sure that Tom is right.
Non dubito quin Thomas recte dicat.
I'm sure that Tom is wrong.
Non dubito quin Thomas erret.
And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.
Et prætereuntibus Madianitis negotiatoribus, extrahentes Ioseph de cisterna, vendiderunt eum Ismaelitis viginti argenteis. Qui duxerunt eum in Aegyptum.
And Ruben returning to the pit, found not the boy: And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?
Reversusque Ruben ad cisternam non invenit puerum et, scissis vestibus, pergens ad fratres suos ait: Puer non comparet, et ego quo ibo?
And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed: Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.
Tulerunt autem tunicam eius et in sanguinem hædi, quem occiderant, tinxerunt mittentes, qui ferrent ad patrem et dicerent: Hanc invenimus; vide, utrum tunica talaris filii tui sit an non?
And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.
Quam cum agnovisset pater, ait: Tunica filii mei est; fera pessima comedit eum, bestia devoravit Ioseph.
And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.
Scissisque vestibus, indutus est cilicio lugens filium suum multo tempore.
And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,
Congregatis autem cunctis liberis eius, ut lenirent dolorem patris, noluit consolationem accipere et ait: “Descendam ad filium meum lugens in infernum”. Et flevit super eo pater eius.
The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharaoh, captain of the soldiers.
Madianitæ autem vendiderunt Ioseph in Aegypto Putiphari eunucho pharaonis, magistro satellitum.
At that time Juda went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Odollamite, named Hiras.
Eo tempore descendens Iudas a fratribus suis divertit ad virum Odollamitem nomine Hiram.
And he saw there the daughter of a man of Canaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he went in unto her. And she conceived, and bore a son, and called his name Her.
Viditque ibi filiam hominis Chananæi vocabulo Sue et, accepta uxore, ingressus est ad eam. Quæ concepit et peperit filium vocavitque nomen eius Her.
And conceiving again, she bore a son, and called him Onan.
Rursumque concepto fetu, natum filium nominavit Onan.
She bore also a third: whom she called Sela. After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.
Tertium quoque peperit, quem appellavit Sela. Ipsa autem erat in Chasib, quando peperit illum.
And Juda took a wife for Her, his first born, whose name was Thamar.
Dedit autem Iudas uxorem primogenito suo Her nomine Thamar.
And Her, the first born of Juda, was wicked in the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.
Fuit quoque Her primogenitus Iudæ nequam in conspectu Domini, et ab eo occisus est.
Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in to thy brother's wife and marry her, that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother.
Dixit ergo Iudas ad Onan: Ingredere ad uxorem fratris tui et sociare illi, ut suscites semen fratri tuo.
He knowing that the children should not be his, when he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children should be born in his brother's name.
Ille, sciens non sibi nasci hunc filium, introiens ad uxorem fratris sui semen fundebat in terram, ne proles fratris nomine nasceretur.
And therefore the Lord slew him, because he did a detestable thing.
Et idcirco occidit et eum Dominus, quod rem detestabilem fecerat.
Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his daughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid lest he also might die, as his brethren did. She went her way, and dwelt in her father's house.
Quam ob rem dixit Iudas Thamar nurui suæ: “Esto vidua in domo patris tui, donec crescat Sela filius meus”. Timebat, enim, ne et ipse moreretur sicut fratres eius. Quæ abiit et habitavit in domo patris sui.
And after many days were past: the daughter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his flock.
Evolutis autem multis diebus, mortua est filia Sue uxor Iudæ. Qui, post luctum consolatione suscepta, ascendebat ad tonsores ovium suarum ipse et Hiras amicus suus Odollamites in Thamnam.
And it was told Thamar that her father-in-law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.
Nuntiatumque est Thamar quod socer illius ascenderet in Thamnam ad tondendas oves.
And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been married to him.
Quæ, depositis viduitatis vestibus, cooperuit se velo et, mutato habitu, sedit in porta Enaim in via, quæ ducit Thamnam; eo quod crevisset Sela, et non eum accepisset maritum.
When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.
Quam cum vidisset Iudas, suspicatus est esse meretricem; operuerat enim vultum suum.
And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter-in-law.
Declinansque ad eam in via ait: “Veni, coeam tecum”; nesciebat enim quod nurus sua esset.
And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?
Qua respondente: “Quid mihi dabis, ut fruaris concubitu meo?”, dixit.
He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock.
Dixit: Mittam tibi hædum de gregibus.
And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest.
Rursum illa dicente: Si dederis mihi arrabonem, donec mittas illum.
Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand.
Ait Iudas: “Quid vis tibi pro arrabone dari?” Respondit: “Sigillum tuum et funiculum et baculum, quem manu tenes”.
The woman therefore at one copulation conceived. And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.
Et dedit ei. In coitu cum eo mulier concepit et surgens abiit; depositoque velo, induta est viduitatis vestibus.
And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her, asked the men of that place: Where is the woman that sat in the cross way?
Misit autem Iudas hædum per amicum suum Odollamitem, ut reciperet pignus, quod dederat mulieri. Qui cum non invenisset eam, interrogavit homines loci illius: Ubi est meretrix, quæ sedebat in Enaim in via?
And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place, he returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover, the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.
Respondentibus cunctis: “Non fuit in loco isto meretrix”, reversus est ad Iudam et dixit ei: “Non inveni eam; sed et homines loci illius dixerunt mihi numquam ibi sedisse scortum”.
Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely she cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.
Ait Iudas: Habeat sibi; ne simus in ludibrium. Ego misi hædum, quem promiseram, et tu non invenisti eam.
And behold, after three months, they told Juda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly.
Ecce autem post tres menses nuntiaverunt Iudæ dicentes: Fornicata est Thamar nurus tua et gravida est ex fornicatione.
And Juda said: Bring her out that she may be burnt.
Dixitque Iudas: Producite eam, ut comburatur.
But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.
Quæ cum educeretur ad pœnam, misit ad socerum suum dicens: De viro, cuius hæc sunt, concepi; cognosce cuius sit sigillum et funiculus et baculus”.
I'm afraid it'll rain tomorrow.
Vereor ne cras pluat.
I'm afraid it'll rain tomorrow.
Timeo ne cras pluat.
But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However he knew her no more.
Qui, agnitis pignoribus, ait: “Iustior me est, quia non tradidi eam Sela filio meo”. Attamen ultra non cognovit illam.
And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying: This shall come forth the first.
Instante autem partu, apparuerunt gemini in utero; atque in ipsa effusione infantium unus protulit manum, in qua obstetrix ligavit coccinum dicens: Iste egressus est prior.
But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.
Illo vero retrahente manum, egressus est frater eius; dixitque mulier: “Qualem rupisti tibi rupturam?” Et ob hanc causam vocatum est nomen eius Phares (id est Ruptura).
Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called his name Zara.
Postea egressus est frater eius, in cuius manu erat coccinum; qui appellatus est Zara (id est Ortus solis).
And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharaoh, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought.
Igitur Ioseph ductus est in Aegyptum; emitque eum Putiphar eunuchus pharaonis, princeps satellitum, vir Aegyptius, de manu Ismaelitarum, a quibus perductus erat.
And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master's house.
Fuitque Dominus cum eo, et erat vir in cunctis prospere agens habitabatque in domo domini sui.
Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
Qui optime noverat esse Dominum cum eo et omnia, quæ gereret, ab eo dirigi in manu illius.
And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him: And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home and in the fields.
Invenitque loseph gratiam coram domino suo et ministrabat ei. Et factum est, postquam præposuit eum domui suæ et omnia, quæ possidebat, tradidit in manum eius, benedixit Dominus domui Aegyptii propter Ioseph, et benedictio Domini erat in omni possessione eius tam in ædibus quam in agris.
Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate.
Et reliquit omnia, quæ possidebat, in manu Ioseph nec cum eo quidquam aliud noverat nisi panem, quo vescebatur.
And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold.
Erat autem Ioseph pulchra facie et decorus aspectu.
And after many days, his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.
Post hæc ergo iniecit uxor domini eius oculos suos in Ioseph et ait: Dormi mecum.
But he in no wise consenting to that wicked act said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house: Neither is there any thing which is not in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife; how then can I do this wicked thing, and sin against my God?
Qui nequaquam acquiescens dixit ad eam: Ecce dominus meus, omnibus mihi traditis, non curat de ulla re in domo sua, nec quisquam maior est in domo hac quam ego, et nihil mihi subtraxit præter te, quæ uxor eius es. Quomodo ergo possum malum hoc magnum facere et peccare in Deum?
With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery.
Huiuscemodi verbis per singulos dies et mulier molesta erat adulescenti, et ille recusabat stuprum.
Now it happened on a certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business, without any man with him: And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.
Accidit autem quadam die, ut intraret Ioseph domum et opus suum absque arbitris faceret; illa, apprehensa lacinia vestimenti eius, dixit: “Dormi mecum”. Qui, relicto in manu illius pallio, fugit et egressus est foras.
And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded, she called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and when I cried out, and he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.
Cumque vidisset illum mulier vestem reliquisse in manibus suis et fugisse foras, vocavit homines domus suæ et ait ad eos: En introduxit virum Hebræum, ut illuderet nobis; ingressus est ad me, ut coiret mecum. Cumque ego succlamassem, et audisset vocem meam, reliquit pallium, quod tenebam, et fugit foras.
For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home: And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought, came to me to abuse me. And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out.
Retentum pallium ostendit marito revertenti domum et secundum verba hæc locuta est: Ingressus est ad me servus Hebræus, quem adduxisti, ut illuderet mihi; cumque audisset me clamare, reliquit pallium, quod tenebam, et fugit foras.
His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife's words, was very angry, and cast Joseph into the prison, where the king's prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.
Dominus, auditis his verbis coniugis, iratus est valde; tradiditque Ioseph in carcerem, ubi vincti regis custodiebantur. Et erat ibi clausus.
But the Lord was with Joseph, and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison.
Fuit autem Dominus cum Ioseph et misertus illius dedit ei gratiam in conspectu principis carceris.
Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done, was under him. Neither did he himself know any thing, having committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper.
Qui tradidit in manu Ioseph universos vinctos, qui in custodia tenebantur, et, quidquid ibi faciendum erat, ipse faciebat, nec princeps carceris spectabat quidquid in manu eius erat: Dominus enim erat cum illo et omnia opera eius dirigebat.
Tom loves this place.
Thomas valde amat hunc locum.
You are my best friend.
Amicus meus optimus es.
After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.
His ita gestis, accidit ut peccarent pincerna regis Aegypti et pistor domino suo.
And Pharaoh being angry with them, (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker,) he sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner.
Iratusque pharao contra duos eunuchos, præpositum pincernarum et præpositum pistorum, misit eos in carcerem principis satellitum, in quo erat vinctus et Ioseph.
But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.
Et princeps satellitum tradidit eos Ioseph, qui ministrabat eis. Aliquantulum temporis illi in custodia tenebantur.
And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves.
Videruntque ambo somnium nocte una iuxta interpretationem congruam sibi.
And when Joseph was come into them in the morning, and saw them sad, he asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder today than usual?
Ad quos cum introisset Ioseph mane et vidisset eos tristes, sciscitatus est eos dicens: Cur tristior est hodie solito facies vestra?
They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Doth not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed:
Qui responderunt: “Somnium vidimus, et non est qui interpretetur nobis”. Dixitque ad eos Ioseph: “Numquid non Dei est interpretatio? Referte mihi quid videritis”.
The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine, on which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes: and the cup of Pharaoh was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharaoh.
Narravit præpositus pincernarum somnium suum: Videbam coram me vitem, in qua erant tres propagines, crescere paulatim in gemmas et post flores uvas maturescere; calicemque pharaonis in manu mea. Tuli ergo uvas et expressi in calicem, quem tenebam, et tradidi poculum pharaoni.
Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days, after which Pharaoh will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou was wont to do.
Respondit Ioseph: Hæc est interpretatio somnii: tres propagines, tres adhuc dies sunt, post quos elevabit pharao caput tuum et restituet te in gradum pristinum; dabisque ei calicem iuxta officium tuum, sicut facere ante consueveras.
Only remember me when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharaoh in mind to take me out of this prison: For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.
Tantum memento mei, cum tibi bene fuerit, et facias mecum misericordiam, ut suggeras pharaoni, ut educat me de isto carcere; quia furto sublatus sum de terra Hebræorum et hic innocens in lacum missus sum.
The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, that I had three baskets of meal upon my head: And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.
Videns pistorum magister quod somnium in bonum dissolvisset, ait: Et ego vidi somnium, quod tria canistra farinæ haberem super caput meum; et in uno canistro, quod erat excelsius, portare me ex omnibus cibis pharaonis, qui fiunt arte pistoria, avesque comedere eos.
Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets, are yet three days, after which Pharaoh will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.
Respondit Ioseph: Hæc est interpretatio somnii: tria canistra, tres adhuc dies sunt, post quos auferet pharao caput tuum ac suspendet te in patibulo, et comedent volucres carnes tuas.
Horses are animals.
Equi bestiae sunt.
The third day after this was the birthday of Pharaoh: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker. And he restored the one to his place, to present him the cup. The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.
Exinde dies tertius natalicius pharaonis erat; qui faciens grande convivium pueris suis elevavit caput magistri pincernarum et caput pistorum principis in medio puerorum suorum; restituitque alterum in locum suum, ut porrigeret ei poculum, alterum suspendit in patibulo, sicut interpretatus erat eis Ioseph.
But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.
Attamen præpositus pincernarum non est recordatus Ioseph, sed oblitus est interpretis sui.
After two years Pharaoh had a dream. He thought he stood by the river, out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.
Post duos annos vidit pharao somnium. Putabat se stare super fluvium, de quo ascendebant septem boves pulchræ et crassæ et pascebantur in locis palustribus.
So Pharaoh awoke. He slept again, and dreamed another dream.
Expergefactus pharao rursum dormivit et vidit alterum somnium.
Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair. Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted, and devoured all the beauty of the former.
Septem spicæ pullulabant in culmo uno plenæ atque formosæ. Aliæ quoque totidem spicæ tenues et percussæ vento urente oriebantur devorantes omnem priorum pulchritudinem.
Pharaoh awaked after his rest.
Evigilavit pharao, et ecce erat somnium!
And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.
Et, facto mane, pavore perterritus misit ad omnes coniectores Aegypti cunctosque sapientes suos; et accersitis narravit somnium, nec erat qui interpretaretur.
I don't have the water.
Aquam non habeo.
Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin.
Tunc demum reminiscens pincernarum magister ait: Confiteor peccatum meum.
The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers, where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.
Iratus rex servis suis me et magistrum pistorum retrudi iussit in carcerem principis satellitum, ubi una nocte uterque vidimus somnium præsagum futurorum.
There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams, and we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.
Erat ibi puer Hebræus eiusdem ducis satellitum famulus, cui narrantes somnia audivimus quidquid postea rei probavit eventus. Ego enim redditus sum officio meo, et ille suspensus est in patibulo.
Forthwith at the king's command Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him: and changing his apparel brought him in to him.
Protinus ad regis imperium eductum de carcere Ioseph totonderunt ac, veste mutata, obtulerunt ei.
And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them.
Cui ille ait: Vidi somnia, nec est qui edisserat; quæ audivi te sapientissime conicere.
Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharaoh a prosperous answer.
Respondit Ioseph: Absque me Deus respondebit prospera pharaoni!
So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river, and seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.
Narravit ergo pharao, quod viderat: Putabam me stare super ripam fluminis et septem boves de amne conscendere pulchras nimis et obesis carnibus, quæ in pastu paludis virecta carpebant.
And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill-favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt. And they devoured and consumed the former, and yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill-favoured as before.
Et ecce has sequebantur aliæ septem boves in tantum deformes et macilentæ, ut numquam tales in terra Aegypti viderim; quæ, devoratis et consumptis prioribus, nullum saturitatis dedere vestigium; sed simili macie et squalore torpebant.
I awoke, and then fell asleep again, and dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk, full and very fair. Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk: And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.
Evigilans, rursus sopore depressus, vidi somnium: Septem spicæ pullulabant in culmo uno plenæ atque pulcherrimæ. Aliæ quoque septem tenues et percussæ vento urente oriebantur e stipula; quæ priorum pulchritudinem devoraverunt. Narravi coniectoribus somnium, et nemo est qui edisserat.
Joseph answered: The king's dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
Respondit Ioseph: Somnium regis unum est: quæ facturus est, Deus ostendit pharaoni.
The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.
Septem boves pulchræ et septem spicæ plenæ septem ubertatis anni sunt; eandemque vim somnii comprehendunt.
And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come: Which shall be fulfilled in this order. Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt, after which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land, and the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.
Septem quoque boves tenues atque macilentæ, quæ ascenderunt post eas, et septem spicæ tenues et vento urente percussæ septem anni sunt venturæ famis, qui hoc ordine complebuntur: ecce septem anni venient fertilitatis magnæ in universa terra Aegypti; quos sequentur septem anni alii tantæ sterilitatis, ut oblivioni tradatur cuncta retro abundantia.
For the famine shall consume all the land, and the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.
Consumptura est enim fames omnem terram, et ubertatis magnitudinem perditura est inopiæ magnitudo.
And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.
Quod autem vidisti secundo ad eandem rem pertinens somnium, firmitatis indicium est, eo quod fiat sermo Dei et velocius a Deo impleatur.
Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt. That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years, that shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up, under Pharaoh's hands, and be reserved in the cities. And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.
Nunc ergo provideat rex virum intellegentem et sapientem et præficiat eum terræ Aegypti constituatque præpositos per cunctas regiones et quintam partem fructuum per septem annos fertilitatis, qui iam nunc futuri sunt, congreget in horrea; et omne frumentum sub pharaonis potestate condatur serveturque in urbibus; et paretur futuræ septem annorum fami, quæ pressura est Aegyptum, et non consumetur terra inopia.
The counsel pleased Pharaoh, and all his servants.
Placuit pharaoni consilium et cunctis ministris eius.
And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?
Locutusque est ad eos: Num invenire poterimus talem virum, qui spiritu Dei plenus sit?
He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?
Dixit ergo ad Ioseph: Quia ostendit tibi Deus omnia, quæ locutus es, numquid sapientiorem et consimilem tui invenire potero?
Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.
Tu eris super domum meam, et ad tui oris imperium cunctus populus meus obœdiet; uno tantum regni solio te præcedam.
And again Pharaoh said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.
Dixitque rursus pharao ad Ioseph: Ecce, constitui te super universam terram Aegypti.
And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.
Tulitque anulum de manu sua et dedit eum in manu eius; vestivitque eum stola byssina et collo torquem auream circumposuit.
And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.
Fecitque eum ascendere super currum suum secundum, clamante præcone: “Abrech!”, ut omnes coram eo genuflecterent et præpositum esse scirent universæ terræ Aegypti.
And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharaoh: without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
Dixit quoque rex ad Ioseph: Ego sum pharao; absque tuo imperio non movebit quisquam manum aut pedem in omni terra Aegypti.
And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis.
Vertitque nomen eius et vocavit eum lingua Aegyptiaca Saphaneth Phanec (quod interpretatur Salvator mundi) deditque illi uxorem Aseneth filiam Putiphare sacerdotis Heliopoleos.
Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt. (Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharaoh), and he went round all the countries of Egypt.
Egressus est itaque Ioseph ad terram Aegypti triginta autem annorum erat quando stetit in conspectu regis pharaonis ­ et circuivit omnes regiones Aegypti.
And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of Egypt. And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.
Venitque fertilitas septem annorum, et segetes congregavit in horrea Aegypti condens in singulis urbibus frumentum camporum in circuitu.
And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.
Tantaque fuit abundantia tritici, ut arenæ maris coæquaretur, et copia mensuram excederet.
And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.
Nati sunt autem Ioseph filii duo, antequam veniret fames, quos ei peperit Aseneth filia Putiphare sacerdotis Heliopoleos.
And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father's house.
Vocavitque nomen primogeniti Manasses dicens: Oblivisci me fecit Deus omnium laborum meorum et domus patris mei.
And he named the second Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.
Nomen quoque secundi appellavit Ephraim dicens: Crescere me fecit Deus in terra paupertatis meæ.
Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in Egypt were passed, the seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt.
Igitur, transactis septem annis ubertatis, qui fuerant in Aegypto, cœperunt venire septem anni inopiæ, quos prædixerat Ioseph, et in universo orbe fames prævaluit; in cuncta autem terra Aegypti erat panis.
And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to Pharaoh, for food. And he said to them: Go to Joseph, and do all that he shall say to you.
Qua esuriente, clamavit populus ad pharaonem alimenta petens. Quibus ille respondit: Ite ad Ioseph et, quidquid vobis dixerit, facite.
And the famine increased daily in all the land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed them also.
Et invaluit fames in omni terra Aegypti; aperuitque Ioseph universa horrea et vendebat Aegyptiis; nam et illos oppresserat fames.
And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.
Omnesque provinciæ veniebant in Aegyptum, ut emerent escas apud Ioseph, quia inopia invaluerat in universa terra.
And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless? I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: Go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want.
Audiens autem Iacob quod alimenta venderentur in Aegypto, dixit filiis suis: Quare aspicitis vos invicem? Audivi quod triticum venumdetur in Aegypto; descendite et emite nobis necessaria, ut possimus vivere et non consumamur inopia.
So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt, whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.
Descenderunt igitur fratres Ioseph decem, ut emerent frumenta in Aegypto, Beniamin fratre Ioseph domi retento a Iacob, qui dixerat fratribus eius: Ne forte in itinere quidquam patiatur mali.
And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Et ingressi sunt filii Israel terram Aegypti cum aliis, qui pergebant ad emendum. Erat autem fames in terra Chanaan.
And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people.
Et Ioseph erat princeps in terra Aegypti, atque ad eius nutum frumenta populis vendebantur.
And when his brethren had bowed down to him, and he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of Canaan, to buy necessaries of life.
Cumque venissent et adorassent eum fratres sui proni in terram, et agnovisset eos, quasi ad alienos durius loquebatur interrogans eos: “Unde venistis?” Qui responderunt: “De terra Chanaan, ut emamus victui necessaria”.
And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.
Et tamen fratres ipse cognoscens non est cognitus ab eis.
And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the land.
Recordatusque somniorum, quæ aliquando viderat, ait ad eos: Exploratores estis; ut videatis infirmiora terræ, venistis!
But they said: It is not so, my lord; but thy servants are come to buy food.
Qui dixerunt: Non est ita, domine; sed servi tui venerunt, ut emerent cibos.
We are all the sons of one man: we are come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any evil.
Omnes filii unius viri sumus; sinceri sumus, nec quidquam famuli tui machinantur mali.
And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.
Quibus ille respondit: Aliter est; immunita terræ huius considerare venistis!
But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.
At illi: Duodecim, inquiunt, servi tui fratres sumus filii viri unius in terra Chanaan; minimus cum patre nostro est, alius non est super.
He saith, This is it that I said: You are spies.
Hoc est, ait, quod locutus sum: exploratores estis!
I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharaoh, you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.
Iam nunc experimentum vestri capiam: per salutem pharaonis, non egrediemini hinc, donec veniat frater vester minimus!
Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharaoh you are spies.
Mittite ex vobis unum, et adducat eum; vos autem eritis in vinculis, donec probentur, quæ dixistis, utrum vera an falsa sint. Alioquin, per salutem pharaonis, exploratores estis!
So he put them in prison three days.
Tradidit ergo illos custodiæ tribus diebus.
And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear God. If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison: and go ye your ways, and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.
Die autem tertio eductis de carcere, ait: Facite, quæ dixi, et vivetis; Deum enim timeo. Si sinceri estis, frater vester unus ligetur in carcere; vos autem abite et ferte frumenta, quæ emistis, in domos vestras, et fratrem vestrum minimum ad me adducite, ut possim vestros probare sermones, et non moriamini.
Do you have any milk?
Habesne lac?
And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die.
Et fratrem vestrum minimum ad me adducite, ut possim vestros probare sermones, et non moriamini.
He came a few days later.
Post dies paucos venit.
They did as he had said. And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.
Fecerunt, ut dixerat, et locuti sunt ad invicem: Merito hæc patimur, quia peccavimus in fratrem nostrum videntes angustiam animæ illius, cum deprecaretur nos, et non audivimus. Idcirco venit super nos ista tribulatio.
And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.
Et Ruben ait: Numquid non dixi vobis: Nolite peccare in puerum? Et non audistis me. En sanguis eius exquiritur.
And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter.
Nesciebant autem quod intellegeret Ioseph, eo quod per interpretem loquebatur ad eos.
And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning, he spoke to them.
Avertitque se parumper et flevit; et reversus locutus est ad eos.
And taking Simeon, and binding him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man's money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so.
Tollensque Simeon et ligans, illis præsentibus, iussit ministris, ut implerent eorum saccos tritico et reponerent pecunias singulorum in sacculis suis, datis supra cibariis in viam. Qui fecerunt ita.
But they having loaded their asses with the corn went their way.
At illi portantes frumenta in asinis suis profecti sunt.
And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack's mouth, and said to his brethren: My money is given me again; behold it is in the sack. And they were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us?
Apertoque unus sacco, ut daret iumento pabulum in deversorio, contemplatus pecuniam in ore sacculi dixit fratribus suis: “Reddita est mihi pecunia: en habetur in sacco!” Et obstupefacti turbatique mutuo dixerunt: “Quidnam est hoc, quod fecit nobis Deus?”
And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying: The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.
Veneruntque ad Iacob patrem suum in terram Chanaan; et narraverunt ei omnia, quæ accidissent sibi, dicentes: Locutus est nobis dominus terræ dure et putavit nos exploratores esse provinciæ.
And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot. We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Canaan.
Cui respondimus: Sinceri sumus, nec ullas molimur insidias; duodecim fratres uno patre geniti sumus, unus non est super, minimus cum patre nostro est in terra Chanaan.
And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways, and bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.
Et dixit nobis vir, dominus terræ: Sic probabo quod sinceri sitis: fratrem vestrum unum dimittite apud me et cibaria domibus vestris necessaria sumite et abite; fratremque vestrum minimum adducite ad me, ut sciam quod non sitis exploratores et istum, qui tenetur in vinculis, recipere possitis ac deinceps peragrandi terram habeatis licentiam.
Mary has two brothers and one sister.
Maria duos fratres et unam sororem habet.
Mary has two brothers and a sister.
Maria duos fratres et unam sororem habet.
When they had told this, they poured out their corn, and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together, their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.
His dictis, cum frumenta effunderent, singuli reppererunt in ore saccorum ligatas pecunias; exterritisque simul omnibus, dixit pater Iacob: Absque liberis me esse fecistis: Ioseph non est super, Simeon tenetur in vinculis, et Beniamin auferetis. In me hæc omnia mala reciderunt.
And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.
Cui respondit Ruben: Duos filios meos interfice, si non reduxero illum tibi; trade illum in manu mea, et ego eum tibi restituam.
But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell.
At ille: Non descendet, inquit, filius meus vobiscum. Frater mortuus est, et ipse solus remansit; si quid ei adversi acciderit in via, deducetis canos meos cum dolore ad inferos.
In the meantime the famine was heavy upon all the land. And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.
Interim fames omnem terram vehementer premebat; consumptisque cibis, quos ex Aegypto detulerant, dixit Iacob ad filios suos: Revertimini et emite nobis pauxillum escarum.
Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.
Respondit Iudas: Denuntiavit nobis vir ille sub attestatione iurisiurandi dicens: "Non videbitis faciem meam, nisi fratrem vestrum minimum adduxeritis vobiscum".
If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee. But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see my face without your youngest brother.
Si ergo vis eum mittere nobiscum, pergemus pariter et ememus tibi necessaria; sin autem non vis, non ibimus. Vir enim, ut sæpe diximus, denuntiavit nobis dicens: Non videbitis faciem meam absque fratre vestro minimo.
Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery, in that you told him you had also another brother.
Dixit eis Israel: Cur in meam hoc fecistis miseriam, ut indicaretis ei et alium habere vos fratrem?
I told him I'd changed my mind.
Ei dixi me mutavisse mentem.
But they answered: The man asked us in order concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him regularly, according to what he demanded: could we know that he would say: Bring hither your brother with you?
At illi responderunt: Interrogavit nos homo per ordinem nostram progeniem: si pater viveret, si haberemus fratrem; et nos respondimus ei consequenter iuxta id, quod fuerat sciscitatus. Numquid scire poteramus quod dicturus esset "Adducite fratrem vestrum vobiscum"?
I want to talk to your mother.
Volo loqui cum matre tua.
His story amused everyone.
Fabula eius omnibus placebat.
Can you understand Tom?
Potesne comprehendere Thoman?
Are you able to understand Tom?
Potesne comprehendere Thoman?
And Juda said to his father: Send the boy with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children perish.
Iudas quoque dixit patri suo Israel: Mitte puerum mecum, ut proficiscamur et possimus vivere, ne moriamur nos et tu et parvuli nostri.
I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever.
Ego spondeo pro puero; de manu mea require illum. Nisi reduxero et reddidero eum tibi, ero peccati reus in te omni tempore.
If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.
Si non intercessisset dilatio, iam vice altera venissemus.
QED.
Q.E.D.
Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.
Igitur Israel pater eorum dixit ad eos: Si sic necesse est, facite, quod vultis; sumite de optimis terræ fructibus in vasis vestris et deferte viro munera: modicum resinæ et mellis et tragacanthum et ladanum, pistacias terebinthi et amygdalas.
And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake. And take also your brother, and go to the man.
Pecuniam quoque duplicem ferte vobiscum et illam, quam invenistis in sacculis, reportate, ne forte errore factum sit; sed et fratrem vestrum tollite et ite ad virum.
Tom looks happy today.
Thomas laetus hodie videtur.
And may my almighty God make him favourable to you: and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin: and as for me I shall be desolate without children.
Deus autem meus omnipotens faciat vobis eum placabilem, et remittat vobiscum fratrem vestrum, quem tenet, et hunc Beniamin. Ego autem quasi orbatus absque liberis ero.
So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
Tulerunt ergo viri munera et pecuniam duplicem et Beniamin descenderuntque in Aegyptum; et steterunt coram Ioseph.
And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at noon.
Quos cum ille vidisset et Beniamin simul, præcepit dispensatori domus suæ dicens: Introduc viros domum et occide victimas et instrue convivium, quoniam mecum sunt comesturi meridie.

He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.
Fecit ille, quod sibi fuerat imperatum, et introduxit viros in domum Ioseph.
And they being much afraid, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses.
Ibique exterriti dixerunt mutuo: Propter pecuniam, quam rettulimus prius in saccis nostris, introducti sumus, ut irruant in nos et violenter subiciant servituti et nos et asinos nostros.
Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door, they said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us. We came down once before to buy food: And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight.
Quam ob rem in ipsis foribus accedentes ad dispensatorem domus locuti sunt: Oramus, domine, ut audias nos. Iam ante descendimus, ut emeremus escas; quibus emptis, cum venissemus ad deversorium, aperuimus saccos nostros et invenimus pecuniam in ore saccorum; quam nunc eodem pondere reportavimus.
And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.
Sed et aliud attulimus argentum, ut emamus, quæ nobis necessaria sunt. Non est in nostra conscientia, quis posuerit argentum in marsupiis nostris.
But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them.
At ille respondit: Pax vobiscum, nolite timere. Deus vester et Deus patris vestri dedit vobis thesauros in saccis vestris; nam pecuniam, quam dedistis mihi, probatam ego habeo. Eduxitque ad eos Simeon.
And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.
Et introductis domum attulit aquam, et laverunt pedes suos; deditque pabulum asinis eorum.
But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.
Illi vero parabant munera, donec ingrederetur Ioseph meridie; audierant enim quod ibi comesturi essent panem.
Then Joseph came in to his house, and they offered him the presents, holding them in their hands; and they bowed down with their face to the ground.
Igitur ingressus est Ioseph domum suam, obtuleruntque ei munera tenentes in manibus suis; et adoraverunt proni in terram.
But he courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?
At ille, clementer resalutatis eis, interrogavit eos dicens: Salvusne est pater vester senex, de quo dixeratis mihi? Adhuc vivit?
And they answered: Thy servant our father is in health; he is yet living. And bowing themselves, they made obeisance to him.
Qui responderunt: “Sospes est servus tuus pater noster, adhuc vivit”. Et incurvati adoraverunt eum.
And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin, his brother by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.
Attollens autem Ioseph oculos vidit Beniamin fratrem suum uterinum et ait: “Iste est frater vester parvulus, de quo dixeratis mihi?” Et rursum: “Deus, inquit, misereatur tui, fili mi”.
And he made haste, because his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: and going into his chamber, he wept.
Festinavitque, quia commota fuerant viscera eius super fratre suo, et erumpebant lacrimæ; et introiens cubiculum flevit.
And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.
Rursumque, lota facie, egressus continuit se et ait: Ponite panes.
And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane):
Quibus appositis, seorsum Ioseph et seorsum fratribus, Aegyptiis quoque, qui vescebantur simul, seorsum­ illicitum est enim Aegyptiis comedere cum Hebræis, et profanum putant huiuscemodi convivium.
They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much; taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.
Sederunt coram eo, primogenitus iuxta primogenita sua et minimus iuxta ætatem suam. Et mirabantur nimis, sumptis partibus, quas ab eo acceperant; maiorque pars venit Beniamin, ita ut quinque partibus excederet. Biberuntque et inebriati sunt cum eo.
And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack. And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.
Præcepit autem Ioseph dispensatori domus suæ dicens: “Imple saccos eorum frumento, quantum possunt capere, et pone pecuniam singulorum in summitate sacci. Scyphum autem meum argenteum et pretium, quod dedit tritici, pone in ore sacci iunioris”. Factumque est ita.
And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.
Et, orto mane, dimissi sunt cum asinis suis.
And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph sending for the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil for good? The cup which you have stolen, is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.
Iamque urbem exierant et processerant paululum, tunc Ioseph, arcessito dispensatore domus: Surge, inquit, et persequere viros; et apprehensis dicito: "Quare reddidistis malum pro bono? Cur furati estis mihi scyphum argenteum? Nonne ipse est, in quo bibit dominus meus et in quo augurari solet? Pessimam rem fecistis!"
He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.
Fecit ille, ut iusserat, et apprehensis per ordinem locutus est.
And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?
Qui responderunt: Quare sic loquitur dominus noster? Absit a servis tuis, ut tantum flagitii commiserimus.
The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?
Pecuniam, quam invenimus in summitate saccorum, reportavimus ad te de terra Chanaan; et quomodo consequens est, ut furati simus de domo domini tui aurum vel argentum?
With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.
Apud quemcumque fuerit inventum servorum tuorum, quod quæris, moriatur; et nos erimus servi domini nostri.
And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.
Qui dixit eis: Fiat iuxta vestram sententiam: apud quemcumque fuerit inventum, ipse sit servus meus; vos autem eritis innoxii.
Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.
Itaque festinato deponentes in terram saccos aperuerunt singuli.
Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.
Quos scrutatus incipiens a maiore usque ad minimum invenit scyphum in sacco Beniamin.
Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.
At illi, scissis vestibus, oneratisque rursum asinis, reversi sunt in oppidum.
And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down before him on the ground.
Et Iudas cum fratribus ingressus est ad Ioseph­ necdum enim de loco abierat omnesque ante eum pariter in terram corruerunt.
And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.
Quibus ille ait: Cur sic agere voluistis? An ignoratis quod non sit similis mei in augurandi scientia?
And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.
Cui Iudas: Quid respondebimus, inquit, domino meo? Vel quid loquemur aut iuste poterimus obtendere? Deus invenit iniquitatem servorum tuorum; en omnes servi sumus domini mei, et nos et apud quem inventus est scyphus.
Joseph answered: God forbid that I should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.
Respondit Ioseph: Absit a me, ut sic agam! Qui furatus est scyphum, ipse sit servus meus; vos autem abite liberi ad patrem vestrum.
Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharaoh thou art.
Accedens autem propius Iudas confidenter ait: Oro, domine mi, loquatur servus tuus verbum in auribus tuis, et ne irascaris famulo tuo; tu es enim sicut pharao!
My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother.
Dominus meus interrogavit prius servos suos: Habetis patrem aut fratrem?
And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.
Et nos respondimus domino meo: Est nobis pater senex et puer parvulus, qui in senectute illius natus est, cuius uterinus frater mortuus est; et ipse solus superest a matre sua, pater vero tenere diligit eum.
And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.
Dixistique servis tuis: Adducite eum ad me, et ponam oculos meos super illum.
We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.
Suggessimus domino meo: Non potest puer relinquere patrem suum; si enim illum dimiserit, morietur.
And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.
Et dixisti servis tuis: Nisi venerit frater vester minimus vobiscum, non videbitis amplius faciem meam.
Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said. And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.
Cum ergo ascendissemus ad famulum tuum patrem nostrum, narravimus ei omnia, quæ locutus est dominus meus, et dixit pater noster: Revertimini et emite nobis parum tritici.
And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man's face.
Cui diximus: Ire non possumus. Si frater noster minimus descenderit nobiscum, proficiscemur simul; alioquin, illo absente, non poterimus videre faciem viri.
Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore me two. One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him; and hitherto he appeareth not. If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.
Ad quæ servus tuus pater meus respondit: Vos scitis quod duos genuerit mihi uxor mea. Egressus est unus a me, et dixi: Bestia devoravit eum! Et hucusque non comparet. Si tuleritis et istum a facie mea, et aliquid ei in via contigerit, deducetis canos meos cum mærore ad inferos.
Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,) and he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.
Igitur, si intravero ad servum tuum patrem meum, et puer defuerit ­ cum anima illius ex huius anima pendeat videritque eum non esse nobiscum, morietur; et deducent famuli tui canos eius cum dolore ad inferos.
Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.
Servus tuus pro puero patri meo spopondit: Nisi reduxero eum, peccati reus ero in patrem meum omni tempore.
Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.
Manebo itaque servus tuus pro puero in ministerio domini mei, et puer ascendat cum fratribus suis.
For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.
Non enim possum redire ad patrem meum, absente puero, ne calamitatis, quæ oppressura est patrem meum, testis assistam.
Tom lives in the city.
Thomas in urbe habitat.
You're the prettiest girl in town.
Virgo pulcherrima oppidi es.
Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by: whereupon he commanded that all should go out, and no stranger be present at their knowing one another.
Non se poterat ultra cohibere Ioseph omnibus coram astantibus, unde clamavit: “Egredimini, cuncti, foras!” Et nemo aderat cum eo, quando manifestavit se fratribus suis.
And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the Egyptians, and all the house of Pharaoh heard.
Elevavitque vocem cum fletu, quam audierunt Aegyptii omnisque domus pharaonis.
And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph: Is my father yet living? His brethren could not answer him, being struck with exceeding great fear.
Et dixit Ioseph fratribus suis: “Ego sum Ioseph! Adhuc pater meus vivit?” Nec poterant respondere fratres nimio terrore perterriti.
And he said mildly to them: Come nearer to me. And when they were come near him, he said: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
Ad quos ille clementer: “Accedite, inquit, ad me”. Et cum accessissent prope: “Ego sum, ait, Ioseph frater vester, quem vendidistis in Aegyptum".
Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries: for God sent me before you into Egypt for your preservation.
Nolite contristari, neque vobis durum esse videatur quod vendidistis me in his regionibus. Pro salute enim vestra misit me Deus ante vos in Aegyptum.
For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reaping.
Biennium est enim quod cœpit fames esse in terra, et adhuc quinque anni restant, quibus nec arari poterit nec meti.
And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.
Præmisitque me Deus, ut reservemini super terram, et servetur vita vestra in salvationem magnam.
Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the will of God: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharaoh, and lord of his whole house, and governor in all the land of Egypt.
Non vestro consilio, sed Dei voluntate huc missus sum, qui fecit me quasi patrem pharaonis et dominum universæ domus eius ac principem in omni terra Aegypti.
Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come down to me, linger not.
Festinate et ascendite ad patrem meum et dicetis ei: Hæc mandat filius tuus Ioseph: "Deus fecit me dominum universæ terræ Aegypti; descende ad me, ne moreris".
And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen: and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and all things that thou hast.
Et habitabis in terra Gessen; erisque iuxta me tu et filii tui et filii filiorum tuorum, oves tuæ et armenta tua et universa, quæ possides.
And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of famine remaining) lest both thou perish, and thy house, and all things that thou hast.
Ibique te pascam­ adhuc enim quinque anni residui sunt famis­ ne et tu pereas et domus tua et omnia, quæ possides.
Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.
En oculi vestri et oculi fratris mei Beniamin vident quia os meum est, quod loquitur ad vos.

January is the first month of the calendar.
Ianuarius est primus mensis calendarii.
You shall tell my father of all my glory, and all things that you have seen in Egypt: make haste and bring him to me.
Nuntiate patri meo universam gloriam meam in Aegypto et cuncta, quæ vidistis. Festinate et adducite eum ad me.
She sings like a nightingale.
Ea sicut philomela cantat.
And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Benjamin in like manner wept also on his neck.
Cumque amplexatus recidisset in collum Beniamin fratris sui, flevit, illo quoque similiter flente, super collum eius.
And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon every one of them: after which they were emboldened to speak to him.
Osculatusque est Ioseph omnes fratres suos et ploravit super singulos. Post quæ ausi sunt loqui ad eum.
And it was heard, and the fame was spread abroad in the king's court: The brethren of Joseph are come; and Pharaoh with all his family was glad.
Auditumque est et celebri sermone vulgatum in aula regis: “Venerunt fratres Ioseph!” Et gavisus est pharao atque omnis familia eius.
And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts, and go into the land of Canaan, and bring away from thence your father and kindred, and come to me; and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, that you may eat the marrow of the land.
Dixitque ad Ioseph, ut imperaret fratribus suis dicens: Onerantes iumenta ite in terram Chanaan et tollite inde patrem vestrum et cognationem et venite ad me; et ego dabo vobis omnia bona Aegypti, ut comedatis medullam terræ.
Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their children and their wives; and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed.
Præcipe etiam: tollite plaustra de terra Aegypti ad subvectionem parvulorum vestrorum ac coniugum et tollite patrem vestrum et properate quantocius venientes.
And leave nothing of your household stuff; for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.
Nec doleatis super supellectilem vestram, quia omnes opes Aegypti vestræ erunt.
And the sons of Israel did as they were bid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharaoh's commandment: and provisions for the way.
Feceruntque filii Israel, ut eis mandatum fuerat. Quibus dedit Ioseph plaustra secundum pharaonis imperium et cibaria in itinere.
He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with five robes of the best, sending to his father as much money and raiment; adding besides, ten he-asses, to carry off all the riches of Egypt, and as many she-asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.
Singulis quoque proferri iussit vestimentum mutatorium; Beniamin vero dedit trecentos argenteos cum quinque vestimentis mutatoriis. Patri suo misit similiter asinos decem, qui subveherent ex omnibus divitiis Aegypti, et totidem asinas triticum et panem et cibum pro itinere portantes.
So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing said to them: Be not angry in the way.
Dimisit ergo fratres suos et proficiscentibus ait: Ne irascamini in via!
And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob. And they told him, saying: Joseph, thy son, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe them.
Qui ascendentes ex Aegypto venerunt in terram Chanaan ad patrem suum Iacob et nuntiaverunt ei dicentes: “Ioseph vivit et ipse dominatur in omni terra Aegypti!” At cor eius frigidum mansit; non enim credebat eis.
They, on the other side, told the whole order of the thing. And when he saw the wagons, and all that he had sent, his spirit revived, and he said: It is enough for me if Joseph, my son, be yet living: I will go and see him before I die.
Tunc referebant omnia verba Ioseph, quæ dixerat eis. Cumque vidisset plaustra et universa, quæ miserat ad adducendum eum, revixit spiritus eius, et ait: Sufficit mihi, si adhuc Ioseph filius meus vivit. Vadam et videbo illum, antequam moriar.
For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
Eo quod in multa sapientia multa sit indignatio; et qui addit scientiam, addit et laborem.

And Israel taking his journey, with all that he had, came to the well of the oath, and killing victims there to the God of his father Isaac, he heard him, by a vision in the night, calling him, and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And he answered him: Lo, here I am.
Profectusque Israel cum omnibus, quæ habebat, venit Bersabee et, mactatis ibi victimis Deo patris sui Isaac, audivit eum per visionem noctis vocantem se: “Iacob, Iacob!” Cui respondit: “Ecce adsum!”
God said to him: I am the most mighty God of thy father; fear not, go down into Egypt, for I will make a great nation of thee there.
Ait illi: Ego sum Deus, Deus patris tui. Noli timere descendere in Aegyptum, quia in gentem magnam faciam te ibi.
I will go down with thee thither, and will bring thee back again from thence: Joseph also shall put his hands upon thy eyes.
Ego descendam tecum illuc et ego inde adducam te revertentem; Ioseph quoque ponet manus suas super oculos tuos.
And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
Surrexit igitur Iacob a Bersabee, tuleruntque eum filii cum parvulis et uxoribus suis in plaustris, quæ miserat pharao ad portandum senem, sumpserunt quoque omnia, quæ possederant in terra Chanaan; veneruntque in Aegyptum Iacob et omne semen eius, filii eius et nepotes, filiæ et cuncta simul progenies.
Our house is your house.
Domus nostra est domus tua.
Our house is your house.
Domus nostra est domus vestra.
All the souls that went with Jacob into Egypt, and that came out of his thigh, besides his sons' wives, sixty-six.
Cunctæ animæ, quæ ingressæ sunt cum Iacob in Aegyptum et egressæ de femore illius, absque uxoribus filiorum eius, sexaginta sex.
And the sons of Joseph, that were born to him in the land of Egypt, two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, that entered into Egypt, were seventy.
Filii autem Ioseph, qui nati sunt ei in terra Aegypti, animæ duæ. Omnes animæ domus Iacob, quæ ingressæ sunt in Aegyptum, fuere septuaginta.
And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen.
Misit autem Iudam ante se ad Ioseph, ut nuntiaret et occurreret in Gessen.
And when he was come thither, Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet his father in the same place: and seeing him, he fell upon his neck, and embracing him, wept.
Et venerunt in terram Gessen. Iunctoque Ioseph curru suo, ascendit obviam patri suo in Gessen; vidensque eum irruit super collum eius et inter amplexus diu flevit.
And the father said to Joseph: Now shall I die with joy, because I have seen thy face, and leave thee alive.
Dixitque Israel ad Ioseph: Iam lætus moriar, quia vidi faciem tuam et superstitem te relinquo.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me.
Et ille locutus est ad fratres suos et ad omnem domum patris sui: Ascendam et nuntiabo pharaoni dicamque ei: Fratres mei et domus patris mei, qui erant in terra Chanaan, venerunt ad me.
And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
Et sunt viri pastores ovium curamque habent alendorum gregum; pecora sua et armenta et omnia, quæ habere potuerunt, adduxerunt secum.
And when he shall call you, and shall say: What is your occupation? You shall answer: We, thy servants, are shepherds, from our infancy until now, both we and our fathers. And this you shall say, that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, because the Egyptians have all shepherds in abomination.
Cumque vocaverit vos et dixerit: "Quod est opus vestrum?" Respondebitis: "Viri pastores sumus servi tui ab infantia nostra usque in præsens et nos et patres nostri". Hæc autem dicetis, ut habitare possitis in terra Gessen, quia detestantur Aegyptii omnes pastores ovium.
Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
Ingressus ergo Ioseph nuntiavit pharaoni dicens: Pater meus et fratres, oves eorum et armenta et cuncta, quæ possident, venerunt de terra Chanaan; et ecce consistunt in terra Gessen.
And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
Ex omnibus fratribus suis quinque viros statuit coram rege, quos ille interrogavit: “Quid habetis operis?” Responderunt: “Pastores ovium sumus servi tui et nos et patres nostri”.
They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Dixeruntque ad pharaonem: Ad peregrinandum in terra venimus, quoniam non est herba gregibus servorum tuorum, ingravescente fame, in terra Chanaan petimusque, ut esse nos iubeas servos tuos in terra Gessen.
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
Dixit itaque rex ad Ioseph: Pater tuus et fratres tui venerunt ad te. Terra Aegypti in conspectu tuo est; in optimo loco fac eos habitare et trade eis terram Gessen. Quod si nosti in eis esse viros industrios, constitue illos magistros pecorum meorum.
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
Post hæc introduxit Ioseph patrem suum ad regem et statuit eum coram eo, qui benedicens illi et interrogatus ab eo: “Quot sunt dies annorum vitæ tuæ?”, respondit: “Dies peregrinationis meæ centum triginta annorum sunt, parvi et mali; et non pervenerunt usque ad dies patrum meorum, quibus peregrinati sunt”.
And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Cumque vocaverit vos et dixerit: "Quod est opus vestrum?" Respondebitis: "Viri pastores sumus servi tui ab infantia nostra usque in præsens et nos et patres nostri". Hæc autem dicetis, ut habitare possitis in terra Gessen, quia detestantur Aegyptii omnes pastores ovium.
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
Et benedicto rege, egressus est foras.
And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
Ioseph vero patri et fratribus suis dedit possessionem in Aegypto in optimo terræ loco, in terra Ramesses, ut præceperat pharao; et alebat eos omnemque domum patris sui præbens cibaria singulis.
And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
In tota terra panis deerat, et oppresserat fames terram valde, defecitque terra Aegypti et terra Chanaan præ fame.
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
E quibus omnem pecuniam congregavit pro venditione frumenti et intulit eam in ærarium regis.
And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.
Cumque defecisset emptoribus pretium, venit cuncta Aegyptus ad Ioseph dicens: Da nobis panes! Quare morimur coram te, deficiente pecunia?
And he answered them: Bring me your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.
Quibus ille respondit: Adducite pecora vestra, et dabo vobis pro eis cibos, si pretium non habetis.
And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.
Quæ cum adduxissent, dedit eis alimenta pro equis et ovibus et bobus et asinis; sustentavitque eos illo anno pro commutatione pecorum.
And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.
Venerunt quoque anno secundo et dixerunt ei: Non celamus dominum nostrum quod, deficiente pecunia, pecora transierunt ad dominum nostrum; nec clam te est quod absque corporibus et terra nihil habeamus.
Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thine, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king's servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness.
Cur ergo moriemur, te vidente, et nos et terra nostra? Eme nos et terram nostram in servitutem regiam et præbe semina, ne, pereunte cultore, redigatur terra in solitudinem.
So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharaoh's hands: and all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof.
Emit igitur Ioseph omnem terram Aegypti, vendentibus singulis possessiones suas præ magnitudine famis. Subiecitque eam pharaoni et cunctos populos eius redegit ei in servitutem, a novissimis terminis Aegypti usque ad extremos fines eius.
Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions.
Terram autem sacerdotum non emit, qui cibariis a rege statutis fruebantur, et idcirco non sunt compulsi vendere possessiones suas.
Then Joseph said to the people: Behold, as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharaoh; take seed and sow the fields, that you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the king; the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children.
Dixit ergo Ioseph ad populos: En, ut cernitis, et vos et terram vestram pharao possidet; accipite semina et serite agros, ut fruges habere possitis. Quintam partem regi dabitis; quattuor reliquas permitto vobis in sementem et in cibum familiis et liberis vestris.
And they answered: our life is in thy hand; only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.
Qui responderunt: Tu salvasti nos! Respiciat nos tantum dominus noster, et læti serviemus regi.
From that time unto this day, in the whole land of Egypt, the fifth part is paid to the kings, and it is become as a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this covenant.
Ex eo tempore usque in præsentem diem in universa terra Aegypti regibus quinta pars solvitur; et factum est a Ioseph in legem absque terra sacerdotali, quæ libera ab hac condicione est.
What do you hear?
Quid audis?
And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
Habitavit ergo Israel in Aegypto, id est in terra Gessen, et possedit eam; auctusque est et multiplicatus nimis.
And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years.
Et vixit Iacob in terra Aegypti decem et septem annis; factique sunt omnes dies vitæ illius centum quadraginta septem annorum.
And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said to him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in Egypt. But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors.
Cumque appropinquare cerneret diem mortis suæ, vocavit filium suum Ioseph et dixit ad eum: Si inveni gratiam in conspectu tuo, pone manum tuam sub femore meo et facies mihi misericordiam et veritatem, ut non sepelias me in Aegypto, sed dormiam cum patribus meis, et auferas me de terra hac condasque in sepulcro maiorum meorum.
And Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast commanded. And he said: Swear then to me. And as he was swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the bed's head.
Cui respondit Ioseph: “Ego faciam, quod iussisti”. Et ille: “Iura ergo, inquit, mihi!” Quo iurante, adoravit Israel conversus ad lectuli caput.
After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick; and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.
His ita transactis, nuntiatum est Ioseph quod ægrotaret pater suus. Et assumpsit secum duos filios Manasse et Ephraim.
And it was told the old man: Behold thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened, he sat on his bed.
Dictumque est seni: “Ecce filius tuus Ioseph venit ad te”. Qui confortatus sedit in lectulo.
And when Joseph was come in to him, he said: God almighty appeared to me at Luza, which is in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me, and said: I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
Et ingresso ad se ait: Deus omnipotens apparuit mihi in Luza, quæ est in terra Chanaan, benedixitque mihi et ait: "Ego te augebo et multiplicabo et faciam te in multitudinem populorum; daboque tibi terram hanc et semini tuo post te in possessionem sempiternam".
So thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.
Duo ergo filii tui, qui nati sunt tibi in terra Aegypti, antequam huc venirem ad te, mei erunt: Ephraim et Manasses sicut Ruben et Simeon reputabuntur mihi.
But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.
Reliquos autem, quos genueris post eos, tui erunt et nomine fratrum suorum vocabuntur in possessionibus suis.
The flower isn't black.
Flos niger non est.
For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Canaan in the very journey, and it was spring time: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.
Mihi enim, quando veniebam de Paddanaram, mortua est Rachel mater tua in terra Chanaan in ipso itinere, cum adhuc esset spatium aliquod usque ad Ephratham, et sepelivi eam iuxta viam Ephrathæ, quæ alio nomine appellatur Bethlehem.
Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these? He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me, that I may bless them.
Videns autem filios eius dixit ad eum: “ Qui sunt isti?” Respondit: “Filii mei sunt, quos donavit mihi Deus in hoc loco”. "Adduc, inquit, eos ad me, ut benedicam illis!”
For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly.
Oculi enim Israel caligabant præ nimia senectute, et clare videre non poterat.
And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them, and said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy seed.
Applicitosque ad se deosculatus et circumplexus eos dixit ad filium suum: Non sum fraudatus aspectu tuo; insuper ostendit mihi Deus semen tuum.
And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.
Cumque tulisset eos Ioseph de gremio patris, adoravit pronus in terram.
And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him.
Et posuit Ephraim ad dexteram suam, id est ad sinistram Israel, Manassen vero in sinistra sua, ad dexteram scilicet patris; applicuitque ambos ad eum.
But he, stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses, who was the elder, changing his hands.
Qui extendens manum dexteram, posuit super caput Ephraim minoris fratris, sinistram autem super caput Manasse, qui maior natu erat, commutans manus.
And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day: The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.
Benedixitque Iacob Ioseph et ait: Deus, in cuius conspectu ambulaverunt patres mei Abraham et Isaac, Deus, qui pascit me ab adulescentia mea usque in præsentem diem, Angelus, qui eruit me de cunctis malis, benedicat pueris istis! Et invocetur super eos nomen meum, nomina quoque patrum meorum Abraham et Isaac, et crescant in multitudinem super terram!
And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father's hand, he tried to lift it from Ephraim's head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.
Videns autem Ioseph quod posuisset pater suus dexteram manum super caput Ephraim, graviter accepit et apprehensam manum patris levare conatus est de capite Ephraim et transferre super caput Manasse.
And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father; for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.
Dixitque ad patrem: Non ita convenit, pater, quia hic est primogenitus; pone dexteram tuam super caput eius!
But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become a people, and shall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall be greater than he; and his seed shall grow into nations.
Qui renuens ait: Scio, fili mi, scio; et iste quidem erit in populos et multiplicabitur, sed frater eius minor maior erit illo, et semen illius crescet in plenitudinem gentium.
And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.
Benedixitque eis in die illo dicens: In te benedicet Israel atque dicet: "Faciat te Deus sicut Ephraim et sicut Manasse!" Constituitque Ephraim ante Manassen.
And he said to Joseph, his son: Behold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers. I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite with my sword and bow.
Et ait ad Ioseph filium suum: En ego morior, et erit Deus vobiscum reducetque vos ad terram patrum vestrorum. Do tibi partem unam extra fratres tuos, quam tuli de manu Amorræi in gladio et arcu meo.
And Jacob called his sons, and said to them: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you the things that shall befall you in the last days.
Vocavit autem Iacob filios suos et ait eis: Congregamini, ut annuntiem, quæ ventura sunt vobis in diebus novissimis.
Where's Tom's watch?
Ubi est horologium Thomae?
Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye sons of Jacob, hearken to Israel, your father:
Congregamini et audite, filii Iacob, audite Israel patrem vestrum!
Ruben, my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my sorrow; excelling in gifts, greater in command.
Ruben primogenitus meus, tu fortitudo mea et principium roboris mei; prior in dignitate, maior in robore!
Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, and didst defile his couch.
Ebulliens sicut aqua non excellas, quia ascendisti cubile patris tui et maculasti stratum meum.
Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniquity waging war.
Simeon et Levi fratres, vasa violentiæ arma eorum.
Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor my glory be in their assembly: because in their fury they slew a man, and in their self-will they undermined a wall.
In consilium eorum ne veniat anima mea, et in cœtu illorum non sit gloria mea; quia in furore suo occiderunt virum et in voluntate sua subnervaverunt tauros.
Cursed be their fury, because it was stubborn: and their wrath, because it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel.
Maledictus furor eorum, quia pertinax, et indignatio eorum, quia dura! Dividam eos in Iacob et dispergam eos in Israel.
Juda, thee shall thy brethren praise: thy hand shall be on the necks of thy enemies; the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee.
Iuda, te laudabunt fratres tui; manus tua in cervicibus inimicorum tuorum; adorabunt te filii patris tui.
Juda is a lion's whelp: to the prey, my son, thou art gone up: resting thou hast couched as a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?
Catulus leonis Iuda: a præda, fili mi, ascendisti; requiescens accubuit ut leo et quasi leæna; quis suscitabit eum?
I know that Tom is a good teacher.
Scio Thomam magistrum bonum esse.
You're stupid.

Non auferetur sceptrum de Iuda et baculus ducis de pedibus eius, donec veniat ille, cuius est, et cui erit obœdientia gentium.
Tying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass, O my son, to the vine, he shall wash his robe in wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.
Ligans ad vineam pullum suum et ad vitem filium asinæ suæ, lavabit in vino stolam suam et in sanguine uvæ pallium suum.
His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
Nigriores sunt oculi eius vino et dentes eius lacte candidiores.
Zabulon shall dwell on the seashore, and in the road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.
Zabulon in litore maris habitabit et in statione navium, pertingens usque ad Sidonem.
Issachar shall be a strong ass, lying down between the borders.
Issachar asinus fortis, accubans inter caulas.
He saw rest that it was good: and the land that it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder to carry, and became a servant under tribute.
Vidit requiem quod esset bona, et terram quod optima; et supposuit umerum suum ad portandum factusque est tributis serviens.
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
In principio creavit Deus caelum et terram.
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
In principio creavit Deus cælum et terram.
Dan shall judge his people like another tribe in Israel.
Dan iudicabit populum suum sicut una tribuum Israel.
Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, that biteth the horse's heels, that his rider may fall backward.
Fiat Dan coluber in via, cerastes in semita, mordens calcanea equi, ut cadat ascensor eius retro.
I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.
Salutare tuum exspectabo, Domine!

Nephthali, a hart let loose, and giving words of beauty.
Nephthali cerva emissa, dans cornua pulchra.
Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and comely to behold: the daughters run to and fro upon the wall.
Arbor fructifera Ioseph, arbor fructifera super fontem: rami transcendunt murum.
But they that held darts, provoked him, and quarrelled with him, and envied him.
Sed exasperaverunt eum et iurgati sunt, et adversati sunt illi habentes iacula.
His bow rested upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.
Et confractus est arcus eorum, et dissoluti sunt nervi brachiorum eorum per manus Potentis Iacob, per nomen Pastoris, Lapidis Israel.
The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above, with the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
Deus patris tui erit adiutor tuus, et Omnipotens benedicet tibi benedictionibus cæli desuper, benedictionibus abyssi iacentis deorsum, benedictionibus uberum et vulvæ.
The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills should come: may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.
Benedictiones patris tui confortatæ sunt super benedictiones montium æternorum, desiderium collium antiquorum; fiant in capite Ioseph et in vertice nazaræi inter fratres suos.
Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide the spoil.
Beniamin lupus rapax; mane comedet prædam et vespere dividet spolia.
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: these things their father spoke to them, and he blessed every one with their proper blessings.
Omnes hi in tribubus Israel duodecim. Hæc locutus est eis pater suus benedixitque singulis benedictionibus propriis.
And he charged them, saying: I am now going to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite, over against Mambre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought together with the field, of Ephron the Hethite, for a possession to bury in.
Et præcepit eis dicens: Ego congregor ad populum meum; sepelite me cum patribus meis in spelunca Machpela, quæ est in agro Ephron Hetthæi contra Mambre in terra Chanaan, quam emit Abraham cum agro ab Ephron Hetthæo in possessionem sepulcri.
There they buried him, and Sara his wife: there was Isaac buried with Rebecca, his wife: there also Lia doth lie buried.
Ibi sepelierunt eum et Saram uxorem eius, ibi sepultus est Isaac cum Rebecca coniuge sua, ibi et Lia condita iacet.
And when he had ended the commandments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew up his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was gathered to his people.
Finitisque mandatis, quibus filios instruebat, collegit pedes suos super lectulum et obiit; appositusque est ad populum suum.

And when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.
Ioseph ruit super faciem patris flens et deosculans eum.
And he commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father.
Præcepitque servis suis medicis, ut aromatibus condirent patrem.
And while they were fulfilling his commands, there passed forty days: for this was the manner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt mourned for him seventy days.
Quibus iussa explentibus, transierunt quadraginta dies; iste quippe mos erat cadaverum conditorum. Flevitque eum Aegyptus septuaginta diebus.
And the time of the mourning being expired, Joseph spoke to the family of Pharaoh: If I have found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of Pharaoh. For my father made me swear to him, saying: Behold I die; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Canaan. So I will go up and bury my father, and return.
Et, expleto planctus tempore, locutus est Ioseph ad familiam pharaonis: Si inveni gratiam in conspectu vestro, loquimini in auribus pharaonis, eo quod pater meus adiuraverit me dicens: "En morior; in sepulcro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Chanaan, sepelies me"; ascendam nunc et sepeliam patrem meum ac revertar.
And Pharaoh said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.
Dixitque ei pharao: Ascende et sepeli patrem tuum, sicut adiuratus es.
So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharaoh's house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt. And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Goshen.
Quo ascendente, ierunt cum eo omnes servi pharaonis, senes domus eius cunctique maiores natu terræ Aegypti, domus Ioseph cum fratribus suis, absque parvulis et gregibus atque armentis, quæ dereliquerant in terra Gessen.
That's going to be my horse.

Veneruntque ad Gorenatad (id est Aream rhamni), quæ sita est trans Iordanem; ubi celebrantes exsequias planctu magno atque vehementi impleverunt septem dies.
And when the inhabitants of Canaan saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And therefore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt.
Quod cum vidissent habitatores terræ Chanaan, dixerunt: “Planctus magnus est iste Aegyptiis”; et idcirco vocatum est nomen loci illius Abelmesraim (id est Planctus Aegypti).
So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them. And carrying him into the land of Canaan, they buried him in the double cave, which Abraham had bought together with the field for a possession of a burying place, of Ehpron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.
Fecerunt ergo filii Iacob, sicut præceperat eis; et portantes eum in terram Chanaan sepelierunt eum in spelunca Machpela, quam emerat Abraham cum agro in possessionem sepulcri ab Ephron Hetthæo contra faciem Mambre.
And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.
Reversusque est Ioseph in Aegyptum cum fratribus suis et omni comitatu, sepulto patre.
Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another: Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him.
Quo mortuo, timentes fratres eius et mutuo colloquentes: Ne forte memor sit iniuriæ, quam passus est, et reddat nobis omne malum, quod fecimus.
And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died, that we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they practised against thee.
Mandaverunt ei dicentes: Pater tuus præcepit nobis, antequam moreretur, ut hæc tibi verbis illius diceremus: "Obsecro, ut obliviscaris sceleris fratrum tuorum et peccati atque malitiæ, quam exercuerunt in te".
We also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.
"Nos quoque oramus, ut servis Dei patris tui dimittas iniquitatem hanc". Quibus auditis, flevit Ioseph.
And his brethren came to him; and worshipping prostrate on the ground, they said: We are thy servants.
Veneruntque ad eum fratres sui et proni coram eo dixerunt: Servi tui sumus.
And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the will of God?
Quibus ille respondit: Nolite timere. Num Dei possumus resistere voluntati?
You thought evil against me: but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people.
Vos cogitastis de me malum; sed Deus vertit illud in bonum, ut exaltaret me, sicut in præsentiarum cernitis, et salvos faceret multos populos.
Fear not: I will feed you and your children.
Nolite timere: ego pascam vos et parvulos vestros.
And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.
Consolatusque est eos et blande ac leniter est locutus.
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Quibus ille respondit: Nolite timere. Num Dei possumus resistere voluntati?
And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's house; and lived a hundred and ten years.
Et habitavit in Aegypto cum omni domo patris sui; vixitque centum decem annis.
And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the sons of Manasses, were born on Joseph's knees.
Et vidit Ephraim filios usque ad tertiam generationem; filii quoque Machir filii Manasse nati sunt in genibus Ioseph.
After which he told his brethren: God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Quibus transactis, locutus est fratribus suis: Post mortem meam Deus visitabit vos et ascendere vos faciet de terra ista ad terram, quam iuravit Abraham, Isaac et Iacob.
And he made them swear to him, saying: God will visit you, carry my bones with you out of this place.
Cumque adiurasset eos atque dixisset: “Deus visitabit vos; asportate ossa mea vobiscum de loco isto”.
And he died, being a hundred and ten years old. And being embalmed, he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.
Mortuus est, expletis centum decem vitæ suæ annis. Et conditus aromatibus repositus est in loculo in Aegypto.
And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.
Terra autem erat inanis et vacua, et tenebræ super faciem abyssi, et spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas.
And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.
Et vidit Deus lucem quod esset bona et divisit Deus lucem ac tenebras.
And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.
Appellavitque Deus lucem Diem et tenebras Noctem. Factumque est vespere et mane, dies unus.
And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.
Dixit quoque Deus: Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum et dividat aquas ab aquis.
And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.
Et fecit Deus firmamentum divisitque aquas, quæ erant sub firmamento, ab his, quæ erant super firmamentum. Et factum est ita.
And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.
Vocavitque Deus firmamentum Cælum. Et factum est vespere et mane, dies secundus.
God also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.
Dixit vero Deus: “Congregentur aquæ, quæ sub cælo sunt, in locum unum, et appareat arida”. Factumque est ita.
And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
Et vocavit Deus aridam Terram congregationesque aquarum appellavit Maria. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
Et ait Deus: “Germinet terra herbam virentem et herbam facientem semen et lignum pomiferum faciens fructum iuxta genus suum, cuius semen in semetipso sit super terram”. Et factum est ita.
And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Et protulit terra herbam virentem et herbam afferentem semen iuxta genus suum lignumque faciens fructum, qui habet in semetipso sementem secundum speciem suam. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
Et factum est vespere et mane, dies tertius.
And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: to shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth, and it was so done.
Dixit autem Deus: “Fiant luminaria in firmamento cæli, ut dividant diem ac noctem et sint in signa et tempora et dies et annos, ut luceant in firmamento cæli et illuminent terram". Et factum est ita.
And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.
Fecitque Deus duo magna luminaria: luminare maius, ut præesset diei, et luminare minus, ut præesset nocti, et stellas.
And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth. And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
Et posuit eas Deus in firmamento cæli, ut lucerent super terram et præessent diei ac nocti et dividerent lucem ac tenebras. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
And the evening and morning were the fourth day.
Et factum est vespere et mane, dies quartus.
God also said: let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.
Dixit etiam Deus: Pullulent aquæ reptile animæ viventis, et volatile volet super terram sub firmamento cæli.
You keep them.
Retine eos.
Do you remember us?
Meministine nostri?
Human life is short.
Vita humana brevis est.
And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Creavitque Deus cete grandia et omnem animam viventem atque motabilem, quam pullulant aquæ secundum species suas, et omne volatile secundum genus suum. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.
Benedixitque eis Deus dicens: Crescite et multiplicamini et replete aquas maris, avesque multiplicentur super terram.
And the evening and morning were the fifth day.
Et factum est vespere et mane, dies quintus.
And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.
Dixit quoque Deus: “Producat terra animam viventem in genere suo, iumenta et reptilia et bestias terræ secundum species suas”. Factumque est ita.
And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Et fecit Deus bestias terræ iuxta species suas et iumenta secundum species suas et omne reptile terræ in genere suo. Et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.
And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.
Et ait Deus: Faciamus hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem nostram; et præsint piscibus maris et volatilibus cæli et bestiis universæque terræ omnique reptili, quod movetur in terra.
And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.
Et creavit Deus hominem ad imaginem suam; ad imaginem Dei creavit illum; masculum et feminam creavit eos.
And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.
Benedixitque illis Deus et ait illis Deus: Crescite et multiplicamini et replete terram et subicite eam et dominamini piscibus maris et volatilibus cæli et universis animantibus, quæ moventur super terram.
And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat.
Dixitque Deus: Ecce dedi vobis omnem herbam afferentem semen super terram et universa ligna, quæ habent in semetipsis fructum ligni portantem sementem, ut sint vobis in escam.
And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon.
Et cunctis animantibus terræ omnique volucri cæli et universis, quæ moventur in terra et in quibus est anima vivens, omnem herbam virentem ad vescendum.
And it was so done. And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.
Et factum est ita. Viditque Deus cuncta, quæ fecit, et ecce erant valde bona. Et factum est vespere et mane, dies sextus.
So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.
Igitur perfecti sunt cæli et terra et omnis exercitus eorum.
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
Complevitque Deus die septimo opus suum, quod fecerat, et requievit die septimo ab universo opere, quod patrarat.
And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
Et benedixit Deus diei septimo et sanctificavit illum, quia in ipso requieverat ab omni opere suo, quod creavit Deus, ut faceret.
These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the Earth.
Istæ sunt generationes cæli et terræ, quando creata sunt in die quo fecit Dominus Deus terram et cælum.
And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.
Et omne virgultum agri, antequam oriretur in terra, omnisque herba regionis, priusquam germinaret; non enim pluerat Dominus Deus super terram, et homo non erat, qui operaretur humum.
But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.
Sed fons ascendebat e terra irrigans universam superficiem terræ. ­ ­
And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.
Tunc formavit Dominus Deus hominem pulverem de humo et inspiravit in nares eius spiraculum vitæ, et factus est homo in animam viventem.
And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.
Et plantavit Dominus Deus paradisum in Eden ad orientem, in quo posuit hominem, quem formaverat.
And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Produxitque Dominus Deus de humo omne lignum pulchrum visu et ad vescendum suave, lignum etiam vitæ in medio paradisi lignumque scientiæ boni et mali.
And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.
Et fluvius egrediebatur ex Eden ad irrigandum paradisum, qui inde dividitur in quattuor capita.
The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth. And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.
Nomen uni Phison: ipse est, qui circuit omnem terram Hevila, ubi est aurum; et aurum terræ illius optimum est; ibi invenitur bdellium et lapis onychinus.
And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia.
Et nomen fluvio secundo Geon: ipse est, qui circuit omnem terram Aethiopiæ.
And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
Nomen vero fluminis tertii Tigris: ipse vadit ad orientem Assyriæ. Fluvius autem quartus ipse est Euphrates.
They live on the other side of the river.
Trans flumen habitant.
Be good.
Esto bonus.
Be good.
Esto bona.
Be good.
Estote boni.
Be good.
Estote bonæ.
And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it.
Tulit ergo Dominus Deus hominem et posuit eum in paradiso Eden, ut operaretur et custodiret illum.
And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.
Præcepitque Dominus Deus homini dicens: Ex omni ligno paradisi comede; de ligno autem scientiæ boni et mali ne comedas; in quocumque enim die comederis ex eo, morte morieris.
And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.
Dixit quoque Dominus Deus: Non est bonum esse hominem solum; faciam ei adiutorium simile sui.
And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.
Formatis igitur Dominus Deus de humo cunctis animantibus agri et universis volatilibus cæli, adduxit ea ad Adam, ut videret quid vocaret ea; omne enim, quod vocavit Adam animæ viventis, ipsum est nomen eius.
And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.
Appellavitque Adam nominibus suis cuncta pecora et universa volatilia cæli et omnes bestias agri; Adæ vero non inveniebatur adiutor similis eius.
Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.
Immisit ergo Dominus Deus soporem in Adam. Cumque obdormisset, tulit unam de costis eius et replevit carnem pro ea.
And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.
Et ædificavit Dominus Deus costam, quam tulerat de Adam, in mulierem et adduxit eam ad Adam.
And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.
Dixitque Adam: Hæc nunc os ex ossibus meis et caro de carne mea! Hæc vocabitur Virago, quoniam de viro sumpta est hæc.
Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.
Quam ob rem relinquet vir patrem suum et matrem et adhærebit uxori suæ; et erunt in carnem unam.
And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.
Erant autem uterque nudi, Adam scilicet et uxor eius, et non erubescebant.
Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?
Et serpens erat callidior cunctis animantibus agri, quæ fecerat Dominus Deus. Qui dixit ad mulierem: Verene præcepit vobis Deus, ut non comederetis de omni ligno paradisi?
And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.
Cui respondit mulier: De fructu lignorum, quæ sunt in paradiso, vescimur; de fructu vero ligni, quod est in medio paradisi, præcepit nobis Deus, ne comederemus et ne tangeremus illud, ne moriamur.
And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death. For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.
Dixit autem serpens ad mulierem: Nequaquam morte moriemini! Scit enim Deus quod in quocumque die comederitis ex eo, aperientur oculi vestri, et eritis sicut Deus scientes bonum et malum.
And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.
Vidit igitur mulier quod bonum esset lignum ad vescendum et pulchrum oculis et desiderabile esset lignum ad intellegendum; et tulit de fructu illius et comedit deditque etiam viro suo secum, qui comedit.
Where is the horse?
Ubi equus est?
And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.
Et aperti sunt oculi amborum. Cumque cognovissent esse se nudos, consuerunt folia ficus et fecerunt sibi perizomata.
And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.
Et cum audissent vocem Domini Dei deambulantis in paradiso ad auram post meridiem, abscondit se Adam et uxor eius a facie Domini Dei in medio ligni paradisi.
And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?
Vocavitque Dominus Deus Adam et dixit ei: Ubi es?
And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.
Qui ait: Vocem tuam audivi in paradiso et timui eo quod nudus essem et abscondi me.
And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?
Cui dixit: Quis enim indicavit tibi quod nudus esses, nisi quod ex ligno, de quo tibi præceperam, ne comederes, comedisti?
And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
Dixitque Adam: Mulier, quam dedisti sociam mihi, ipsa dedit mihi de ligno, et comedi.
And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.
Et dixit Dominus Deus ad mulierem: “Quid hoc fecisti?” Quæ respondit: “Serpens decepit me, et comedi”.
And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
Et ait Dominus Deus ad serpentem: Quia fecisti hoc, maledictus es inter omnia pecora et omnes bestias agri! Super pectus tuum gradieris et pulverem comedes cunctis diebus vitæ tuæ.
I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.
Inimicitias ponam inter te et mulierem et semen tuum et semen ilius; ipsum conteret caput tuum, et tu conteres calcaneum eius.
To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.
Mulieri dixit: Multiplicabo ærumnas tuas et conceptus tuos: in dolore paries filios, et ad virum tuum erit appetitus tuus, ipse autem dominabitur tui.
And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work: with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.
Adæ vero dixit: Quia audisti vocem uxoris tuæ et comedisti de ligno, ex quo præceperam tibi, ne comederes, maledicta humus propter te! In laboribus comedes ex ea cunctis diebus vitæ tuæ.
Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.
Spinas et tribulos germinabit tibi, et comedes herbas terræ; in sudore vultus tui vesceris pane, donec revertaris ad humum, de qua sumptus es, quia pulvis es et in pulverem reverteris.
And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.
Et vocavit Adam nomen uxoris suæ Eva, eo quod mater esset cunctorum viventium.
And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.
Fecit quoque Dominus Deus Adæ et uxori eius tunicas pelliceas et induit eos.
And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.
Et ait Dominus Deus: Ecce homo factus est quasi unus ex nobis, ut sciat bonum et malum; nunc ergo, ne mittat manum suam et sumat etiam de ligno vitæ et comedat et vivat in æternum!
And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.
Emisit eum Dominus Deus de paradiso Eden, ut operaretur humum, de qua sumptus est.
And he cast out Adam: and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubim, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Eiecitque hominem et collocavit ad orientem paradisi Eden cherubim et flammeum gladium atque versatilem ad custodiendam viam ligni vitæ.
And Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.
Adam vero cognovit Evam uxorem suam, quæ concepit et peperit Cain dicens: Acquisivi virum per Dominum.
And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.
Rursusque peperit fratrem eius Abel. Et fuit Abel pastor ovium et Cain agricola.
And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.
Factum est autem post aliquot dies ut offerret Cain de fructibus agri munus Domino.
Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.
Abel quoque obtulit de primogenitis gregis sui et de adipibus eorum. Et respexit Dominus ad Abel et ad munus eius.
But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceeding angry, and his countenance fell.
Ad Cain vero et ad munus illius non respexit. Iratusque est Cain vehementer, et concidit vultus eius.
And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?
Dixitque Dominus ad eum: Quare iratus es, et cur concidit facies tua?
If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.
Nonne si bene egeris, vultum attolles? Sin autem male, in foribus peccatum insidiabitur, et ad te erit appetitus eius, tu autem dominaberis illius.
And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.
Dixitque Cain ad Abel fratrem suum: “Egrediamur foras”. Cumque essent in agro, consurrexit Cain adversus Abel fratrem suum et interfecit eum.
And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered: I know not: am I my brother's keeper?
Et ait Dominus ad Cain: “Ubi est Abel frater tuus?” Qui respondit: “Nescio. Num custos fratris mei sum ego?”
And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.
Dixitque ad eum: Quid fecisti? Vox sanguinis fratris tui clamat ad me de agro.
Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.
Nunc igitur maledictus eris procul ab agro, qui aperuit os suum et suscepit sanguinem fratris tui de manu tua!
When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.
Cum operatus fueris eum, amplius non dabit tibi fructus suos; vagus et profugus eris super terram.
And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.
Dixitque Cain ad Dominum: Maior est pœna mea quam ut portem eam.
Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me.
Ecce eicis me hodie a facie agri, et a facie tua abscondar et ero vagus et profugus in terra; omnis igitur, qui invenerit me, occidet me.
And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not so be: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.
Dixitque ei Dominus: “Nequaquam ita fiet, sed omnis qui occiderit Cain, septuplum punietur!” Posuitque Dominus Cain signum, ut non eum interficeret omnis qui invenisset eum.
And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
Dixitque Cain ad Dominum: Maior est pœna mea quam ut portem eam.
And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
Egressusque Cain a facie Domini habitavit in terra Nod ad orientalem plagam Eden.
And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.
Cognovit autem Cain uxorem suam, quæ concepit et peperit Henoch. Et ædificavit civitatem vocavitque nomen eius ex nomine filii sui Henoch.
And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech.
Porro Henoch genuit Irad, et Irad genuit Maviael, et Maviael genuit Mathusael, et Mathusael genuit Lamech.
Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other Sella.
Qui accepit uxores duas: nomen uni Ada et nomen alteri Sella.
And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.
Genuitque Ada Iabel, qui fuit pater habitantium in tentoriis atque pastorum.
We split the loot three ways.
Praedam in tres partes divisimus.
Do what you consider necessary.
Fac quodlibet necesse putas.
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.
Et nomen fratris eius Iubal; ipse fuit pater omnium canentium cithara et organo.
Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.
Sella quoque genuit Tubalcain, qui fuit malleator et faber in cuncta opera æris et ferri. Soror vero Tubalcain Noema.
And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.
Dixitque Lamech uxoribus suis: Ada et Sella, audite vocem meam; uxores Lamech, auscultate sermonem meum: occidi virum pro vulnere meo et adulescentulum pro livore meo.
Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.
Septuplum ultio dabitur de Cain, de Lamech vero septuagies septies.
Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed for Abel, whom Cain slew.
Cognovit quoque Adam uxorem suam, et peperit filium vocavitque nomen eius Seth dicens: Posuit mihi Deus semen aliud pro Abel, quem occidit Cain.
But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos: this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.
Sed et Seth natus est filius, quem vocavit Enos. Tunc cœperunt invocare nomen Domini.
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.
Sed et Seth natus est filius, quem vocavit Enos. Tunc cœperunt invocare nomen Domini.

And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.
Vixit quoque Seth centum quinque annos et genuit Enos.

And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
Vixitque Seth, postquam genuit Enos, octingentis septem annis genuitque filios et filias.
And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
Et facti sunt omnes dies Seth nongentorum duodecim annorum, et mortuus est.
And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son. And he called his name Noah, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth, which the Lord hath cursed.
Vixit autem Lamech centum octoginta duobus annis et genuit filium vocavitque nomen eius Noe dicens: Iste consolabitur nos ab operibus nostris et labore manuum nostrarum in agro, cui maledixit Dominus.
And Lamech lived after he begot Noah, five hundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters.
Vixitque Lamech, postquam genuit Noe, quingentos nonaginta quinque annos et genuit filios et filias.
And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
Et facti sunt omnes dies Lamech septingenti septuaginta septem anni, et mortuus est.
And Noah, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.
Noe vero, cum quingentorum esset annorum, genuit Sem, Cham et Iapheth.
And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them, the sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all which they chose.
Cumque cœpissent homines multiplicari super terram et filias procreassent, videntes filii Dei filias hominum quod essent pulchræ, acceperunt sibi uxores ex omnibus, quas elegerant.
And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
Cumque cœpissent homines multiplicari super terram et filias procreassent, videntes filii Dei filias hominum quod essent pulchræ, acceperunt sibi uxores ex omnibus, quas elegerant.

And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
Dixitque Deus: Non permanebit spiritus meus in homine in æternum, quia caro est; eruntque dies illius centum viginti annorum.
Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.
Gigantes erant super terram in diebus illis et etiam postquam ingressi sunt filii Dei ad filias hominum, illæque eis genuerunt: isti sunt potentes a sæculo viri famosi.
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
Gigantes erant super terram in diebus illis et etiam postquam ingressi sunt filii Dei ad filias hominum, illæque eis genuerunt: isti sunt potentes a sæculo viri famosi.
And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times, It repented him that he had made man on the earth.
Videns autem Dominus quod multa malitia hominum esset in terra, et cuncta cogitatio cordis eorum non intenta esset nisi ad malum omni tempore, pænituit Dominum quod hominem fecisset in terra.
And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart, he said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.
Et tactus dolore cordis intrinsecus: Delebo, inquit, hominem, quem creavi, a facie terræ, ab homine usque ad pecus, usque ad reptile et usque ad volucres cæli; pænitet enim me fecisse eos.
But Noah found grace before the Lord.
Noe vero invenit gratiam coram Domino.
Noah was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.
Noe vir iustus atque perfectus fuit in generatione sua; cum Deo ambulavit.
And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.
Corrupta est autem terra coram Deo et repleta est iniquitate.
And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth), He said to Noah: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.
Cumque vidisset Deus terram esse corruptam ­ omnis quippe caro corruperat viam suam super terram ­dixit ad Noe: Finis universæ carnis venit coram me; repleta est enim terra iniquitate a facie eorum, et ecce ego disperdam eos de terra.
Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.
Fac tibi arcam de lignis cupressinis; mansiunculas in arca facies et bitumine linies eam intrinsecus et extrinsecus.
And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
Et sic facies eam: trecentorum cubitorum erit longitudo arcæ, quinquaginta cubitorum latitudo et triginta cubitorum altitudo illius.
Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.
Fenestram in arca facies et cubito consummabis summitatem eius. Ostium autem arcæ pones ex latere; tabulatum inferius, medium et superius facies in ea.
Behold, I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.
Ecce ego adducam diluvii aquas super terram, ut interficiam omnem carnem, in qua spiritus vitæ est subter cælum: universa, quæ in terra sunt, consumentur.
And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.
Ponamque fœdus meum tecum; et ingredieris arcam tu et filii tui, uxor tua et uxores filiorum tuorum tecum.
And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.
Et ex cunctis animantibus universæ carnis bina induces in arcam, ut vivant tecum, masculini sexus et feminini.
Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on the earth according to its kind: two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.
De volucribus iuxta genus suum et de iumentis in genere suo et ex omni reptili terræ secundum genus suum: bina de omnibus ingredientur ad te, ut possint vivere.
Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.
Tu autem tolle tecum ex omnibus escis, quæ mandi possunt, et comportabis apud te; et erunt tam tibi quam illis in cibum.
And Noah did all things which God commanded him.
Fecit ergo Noe omnia, quæ præceperat illi Deus; sic fecit.
For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and I will destroy every substance that I have made, from the face of the earth.
Adhuc enim et post dies septem ego pluam super terram quadraginta diebus et quadraginta noctibus et delebo omnem substantiam, quam feci, de superficie terræ.
And Noah was six hundred years old when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.
Eratque Noe sescentorum annorum, quando diluvii aquæ inundaverunt super terram.
And Noah went in and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
Et ingressus est Noe et filii eius, uxor eius et uxores filiorum eius cum eo in arcam propter aquas diluvii.
And of beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls, and of every thing that moveth upon the earth, two and two went in to Noah into the ark, male and female, as the Lord had commanded Noah.
De pecoribus mundis et immundis et de volucribus et ex omni, quod movetur super terram, duo et duo ingressa sunt ad Noe in arcam, masculus et femina, sicut præceperat Deus Noe.
And after the seven days were passed, the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.
Cumque transissent septem dies, aquæ diluvii inundaverunt super terram.
In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the floodgates of heaven were opened.
Anno sescentesimo vitæ Noe, mense secundo, septimo decimo die mensis rupti sunt omnes fontes abyssi magnæ, et cataractæ cæli apertæ sunt.
And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
Et facta est pluvia super terram quadraginta diebus et quadraginta noctibus.
And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from the earth.
Factumque est diluvium quadraginta diebus super terram, et multiplicatæ sunt aquæ et elevaverunt arcam in sublime a terra.
For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the earth: and the ark was carried upon the waters.
Vehementer enim inundaverunt et omnia repleverunt in superficie terræ; porro arca ferebatur super aquas.
And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
Et aquæ prævaluerunt nimis super terram, opertique sunt omnes montes excelsi sub universo cælo.
The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it covered.
Quindecim cubitis altior fuit aqua super montes, quos operuerat.
And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep upon the earth: and all men. And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth, died.
Consumptaque est omnis caro, quæ movebatur super terram, volucrum, pecorum, bestiarum omniumque reptilium, quæ reptant super terram, et universi homines: cuncta, in quibus spiraculum vitæ in terra, mortua sunt.
And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth, from man even to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained, and they that were with him in the ark.
Et delevit omnem substantiam, quæ erat super terram, ab homine usque ad pecus, usque ad reptile et usque ad volucres cæli; et deleta sunt de terra. Remansit autem solus Noe et qui cum eo erant in arca.
And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
Obtinueruntque aquæ terram centum quinquaginta diebus.
I want to study in that school.

And God remembered Noah, and all the living creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.
Recordatus autem Deus Noe cunctorumque animantium et omnium iumentorum, quæ erant cum eo in arca, adduxit spiritum super terram, et imminutæ sunt aquæ.
The fountains also of the deep, and the floodgates of heaven, were shut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.
Et clausi sunt fontes abyssi et cataractæ cæli, et prohibitæ sunt pluviæ de cælo.
And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days. .
Reversæque sunt aquæ de terra euntes et redeuntes et cœperunt minui post centum quinquaginta dies.
And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.
Requievitque arca mense septimo, decima septima die mensis super montes Ararat.
And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
At vero aquæ ibant et decrescebant usque ad decimum mensem; decimo enim mense, prima die mensis, apparuerunt cacumina montium.
And after that forty days were passed, Noah opening the window of the ark, which he had made, sent forth a raven, which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth.
Cumque transissent quadraginta dies, aperiens Noe fenestram arcæ, quam fecerat, dimisit corvum; qui egrediebatur exiens et rediens, donec siccarentur aquæ super terram.
He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.
Emisit quoque columbam a se, ut videret si iam cessassent aquæ super faciem terræ.
But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.
Quæ, cum non invenisset, ubi requiesceret pes eius, reversa est ad eum in arcam; aquæ enim erant super universam terram. Extenditque manum et apprehensam intulit in arcam.
And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.
Exspectatis autem ultra septem diebus aliis, rursum dimisit columbam ex arca.
And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noah therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.
At illa venit ad eum ad vesperam portans ramum olivæ virentibus foliis in ore suo. Intellexit ergo Noe quod cessassent aquæ super terram.
And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.
Exspectavitque nihilominus septem alios dies; et emisit columbam, quæ non est reversa ultra ad eum.
Therefore in the six hundredth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noah opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.
Igitur sescentesimo primo anno, primo mense, prima die mensis, siccatæ sunt aquæ super terram; et aperiens Noe tectum arcæ, et ecce aspexit viditque quod exsiccata erat superficies terræ.
In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.
Mense secundo, septima et vicesima die mensis, arefacta est terra.
And God spoke to Noah, saying: Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons and the wives of thy sons with thee. All living things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase and multiply upon it.
Locutus est autem Deus ad Noe dicens: Egredere de arca tu et uxor tua, filii tui et uxores filiorum tuorum tecum. Cuncta animantia, quæ sunt apud te ex omni carne, tam in volatilibus quam in pecoribus et in universis reptilibus, quæ reptant super terram, educ tecum, ut pullulent super terram et crescant et multiplicentur super eam.
So Noah went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.
Egressus est ergo Noe et filii eius, uxor illius et uxores filiorum eius cum eo.
And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds went out of the ark.
Sed et omnia animantia, iumenta, volatilia et reptilia, quæ reptant super terram, secundum genus suum egressa sunt de arca.
And Noah built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.
Aedificavit autem Noe altare Domino; et tollens de cunctis pecoribus mundis et volucribus mundis obtulit holocausta super altare.
And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.
Odoratusque est Dominus odorem suavitatis et locutus est Dominus ad cor suum: Nequaquam ultra maledicam terræ propter homines, quia cogitatio humani cordis in malum prona est ab adulescentia sua. Non igitur ultra percutiam omnem animam viventem, sicut feci.
All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.
Cunctis diebus terræ, sementis et messis, frigus et æstus, æstas et hiems, dies et nox non requiescent.
And God blessed Noah and his sons. And he said to them: Increase, and multiply, and fill the earth.
Benedixitque Deus Noe et filiis eius et dixit ad eos: Crescite et multiplicamini et implete terram.
And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.
Et terror vester ac tremor sit super cuncta animalia terræ et super omnes volucres cæli cum universis, quæ moventur super terram; omnes pisces maris manui vestræ traditi sunt.
And every thing that moveth, and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you: Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.
Omne, quod movetur et vivit, erit vobis in cibum; quasi holera virentia tradidi vobis omnia, excepto quod carnem cum anima, quæ est in sanguine, non comedetis.
For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.
Sanguinem enim animarum vestrarum requiram de manu cunctarum bestiarum; et de manu hominis, de manu viri fratris eius requiram animam hominis.
Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.
Quicumque effuderit humanum sanguinem, per hominem fundetur sanguis illius; ad imaginem quippe Dei factus est homo.
But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth and fill it.
Vos autem crescite et multiplicamini et pullulate super terram et dominamini ei.
Thus also said God to Noah, and to his sons with him: Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you: And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.
Hæc quoque dixit Deus ad Noe et ad filios eius cum eo: Ecce ego statuam pactum meum vobiscum et cum semine vestro post vos et ad omnem animam viventem, quæ est vobiscum tam in volucribus quam in iumentis et in omnibus bestiis terræ, quæ sunt vobiscum, cunctis, quæ egressa sunt de arca, universis bestiis terræ.
I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.
Statuam pactum meum vobiscum; et nequaquam ultra interficietur omnis caro aquis diluvii, neque erit deinceps diluvium dissipans terram.
And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations. I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me and the earth.
Dixitque Deus: Hoc signum fœderis, quod do inter me et vos et ad omnem animam viventem, quæ est vobiscum, in generationes sempiternas: arcum meum ponam in nubibus, et erit signum fœderis inter me et inter terram.
And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds: And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.
Cumque obduxero nubibus cælum, apparebit arcus meus in nubibus, et recordabor fœderis mei vobiscum et cum omni anima vivente, quæ carnem vegetat; et non erunt ultra aquæ diluvii ad delendum universam carnem.
And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.
Eritque arcus in nubibus, et videbo illum et recordabor fœderis sempiterni, quod pactum est inter Deum et omnem animam viventem universæ carnis, quæ est super terram.
And God said to Noah: This shall be the sign of the covenant, which I have established, between me and all flesh upon the earth.
Dixitque Deus ad Noe: Hoc erit signum fœderis, quod constitui inter me et omnem carnem super terram.
And the sons of Noah, who came out of the ark, were Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
Erant ergo filii Noe, qui egressi sunt de arca, Sem, Cham et Iapheth. Porro Cham ipse est pater Chanaan.
These three are the sons of Noah: and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.
Tres isti filii sunt Noe, et ab his disseminatum est omne hominum genus super universam terram.
And Noah a husbandman began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard. And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.
Cœpitque Noe agricola plantare vineam; bibensque vinum inebriatus est et nudatus in tabernaculo suo.
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
Quod cum vidisset Cham pater Chanaan, verenda scilicet patris sui esse nudata, nuntiavit duobus fratribus suis foras.
But Shem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
At vero Sem et Iapheth pallium imposuerunt umeris suis et incedentes retrorsum operuerunt verecunda patris sui, faciesque eorum aversæ erant, et patris virilia non viderunt.
And Noah awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him, he said: Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
Evigilans autem Noe ex vino, cum didicisset, quæ fecerat ei filius suus minor, ait: Maledictus Chanaan! Servus servorum erit fratribus suis.
And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Shem, be Canaan his servant.
Dixitque: Benedictus Dominus Deus Sem! Sitque Chanaan servus eius.
May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan be his servant.
Dilatet Deus Iapheth, et habitet in tabernaculis Sem, sitque Chanaan servus eius.
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
Vixit autem Noe post diluvium trecentis quinquaginta annis. Et impleti sunt omnes dies eius nongentorum quinquaginta annorum, et mortuus est.
These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in every man with his household: Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin, Dan, and Nephthali, Gad and Asher.
Hæc sunt nomina filiorum Israel, qui ingressi sunt Aegyptum cum Iacob; singuli cum domibus suis introierunt: Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Iuda, Issachar, Zabulon et Beniamin, Dan et Nephthali, Gad et Aser.
And Avram took his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot, and all their possessions that they had acquired, and all the people who they had acquired in Haran, and they left to go to the land of Canaan, and they came into the land of Canaan.
Tulitque Sarai uxorem suam et Lot filium fratris sui universamque substantiam, quam acquisiverant, et animas, quas fecerant in Charran, et egressi sunt, ut irent in terram Chanaan; et venerunt in terram Chanaan.
And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.
Erant igitur omnes animæ eorum, qui egressi sunt de femore Iacob, septuaginta; Ioseph autem in Aegypto erat.
After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation, the children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.
Quo mortuo et universis fratribus eius omnique cognatione illa, filii Israel creverunt et pullulantes multiplicati sunt ac roborati nimis impleverunt terram.
In the meantime there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph. And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we. Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.
Surrexit interea rex novus super Aegyptum, qui ignorabat Ioseph; et ait ad populum suum: Ecce, populus filiorum Israel multus et fortior nobis est; venite, prudenter agamus cum eo, ne forte multiplicetur et, si ingruerit contra nos bellum, addatur inimicis nostris, expugnatisque nobis, egrediatur de terra.
Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens: and they built for Pharaoh cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses.
Præposuit itaque eis magistros operum, ut affligerent eos oneribus; ædificaveruntque urbes promptuarias pharaoni, Phithom et Ramesses.
But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied and increased.
Quantoque opprimebant eos, tanto magis multiplicabantur et crescebant.
And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them. And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.
Formidaveruntque filios Israel Aegyptii et in servitutem redegerunt eos atque ad amaritudinem perducebant vitam eorum operibus duris luti et lateris omnique famulatu, quo in terræ operibus premebantur.
And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua, commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive.
Dixit autem rex Aegypti obstetricibus Hebræorum, quarum una vocabatur Sephra, altera Phua, præcipiens eis: Quando obstetricabitis Hebræas, et partus tempus advenerit, si masculus fuerit, interficite eum; si femina, reservate.
But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.
Timuerunt autem obstetrices Deum et non fecerunt iuxta præceptum regis Aegypti, sed conservabant mares.
And the king called for them and said: What is it that you meant to do, that you would save the men children?
Quibus ad se accersitis rex ait: Quidnam est hoc, quod facere voluistis, ut pueros servaretis?
They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.
Quæ responderunt: Non sunt Hebrææ sicut Aegyptiæ mulieres; ipsæ enim robustæ sunt et, priusquam veniamus ad eas, pariunt.
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong. And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.
Bene ergo fecit Deus obstetricibus, et crevit populus confortatusque est nimis; et, quia timuerunt obstetrices Deum, ædificavit illis domos.
Pharaoh therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.
Præcepit ergo pharao omni populo suo dicens: Quidquid masculini sexus natum fuerit, in flumen proicite; quidquid feminei, reservate.
They invited them to dinner.
Eos ad cenam invitaverunt.
After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred. And she conceived, and bore a son: and seeing him a goodly child, hid him three months.
Egressus est vir de domo Levi et accepit uxorem stirpis suæ; quæ concepit et peperit filium et videns eum elegantem abscondit tribus mensibus.
And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink, his sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.
Cumque iam celare non posset, sumpsit fiscellam scirpeam et linivit eam bitumine ac pice; posuitque intus infantulum et exposuit eum in carecto ripæ fluminis, stante procul sorore eius et considerante eventum rei.
And behold the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's brink.
Ecce autem descendebat filia pharaonis, ut lavaretur in flumine, et puellæ eius gradiebantur per crepidinem alvei
Bear: "It is a happy meeting, dear Leo, for I have not seen you in six whole months."
Ursus: "Sit felix occursus, optime Leo, nam totos sex menses te non vidi."
And when she saw the basket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought, she opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it, she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.
Quæ cum vidisset fiscellam in papyrione, misit unam e famulabus suis; et allatam aperiens cernensque in ea parvulum vagientem, miserta eius ait: De infantibus Hebræorum est hic.
And the child's sister said to her: Shall I go, and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?
Cui soror pueri: Vis, inquit, ut vadam et vocem tibi mulierem Hebræam, quæ nutrire possit tibi infantulum?
And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
Respondit: “Vade”. Perrexit puella et vocavit matrem infantis.
And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
Ad quam locuta filia pharaonis: “Accipe, ait, puerum istum et nutri mihi; ego dabo tibi mercedem tuam”. Suscepit mulier et nutrivit puerum.
And when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharaoh's daughter. And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.
Adultumque tradidit filiæ pharaonis. Quem illa adoptavit in locum filii vocavitque nomen eius Moysen dicens: “Quia de aqua tuli eum”.
In those days, after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews, his brethren.
In diebus illis, postquam creverat, Moyses egressus est ad fratres suos; viditque afflictionem eorum et virum Aegyptium percutientem quendam de Hebræis fratribus suis.
And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
Cumque circumspexisset huc atque illuc et nullum adesse vidisset, percussum Aegyptium abscondit sabulo.
And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?
Et egressus die altero conspexit duos Hebræos rixantes dixitque ei, qui faciebat iniuriam: Quare percutis proximum tuum?
But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us? wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known?
Qui respondit: “Quis te constituit principem et iudicem super nos? Num occidere me tu vis, sicut occidisti Aegyptium?” Timuit Moyses et ait: “Quomodo palam factum est verbum istud?”
And Pharaoh heard of this word, and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.
Audivitque pharao sermonem hunc et quærebat occidere Moysen. Qui fugiens de conspectu eius moratus est in terra Madian; venit ergo in terram Madian et sedit iuxta puteum.
And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.
Supervenere pastores et eiecerunt eas: surrexitque Moyses et, defensis puellis, adaquavit oves earum.
And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?
Quæ cum revertissent ad Raguel patrem suum, dixit ad eas: Cur velocius venistis solito?
They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.
Responderunt: Vir Aegyptius liberavit nos de manu pastorum; insuper et hausit aquam nobis potumque dedit ovibus.
But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.
At ille: “Ubi est?”, inquit. “Quare dimisistis hominem? Vocate eum, ut comedat panem”.
And Moses was content to dwell with the man. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife.
Consensit ergo Moyses habitare cum eo accepitque Sephoram filiam eius uxorem.
And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country.
Quæ peperit ei filium, quem vocavit Gersam dicens: Advena sum in terra aliena.
I'm hungry.
Esurio.
Ruth said, "Don't urge me to leave you, and to return from following you, for where you go, I will go; and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May God do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me."
Quæ respondit: Noli instare mihi, ut relinquam te et abeam; quocumque perrexeris, pergam; ubi morata fueris, et ego pariter morabor: populus tuus populus meus et Deus tuus Deus meus. Quæ te morientem terra susceperit, in ea moriar ibique locum accipiam sepulturæ. Hæc mihi faciat Dominus et hæc addat, si non sola mors me et te separaverit.
A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons.
Abiitque homo de Bethlehem Iudæ, ut peregrinaretur in regione Moabitide cum uxore sua ac duobus liberis.
I wasn't married at that time.
Tunc maritus non eram.
I wasn't married at that time.
Tunc uxor non eram.
We live in a society.
In societate vivimus.
He was afraid of the dog.
Canem timebat.
After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be well with thee.
Et dixit ad eam Noemi socrus sua: Filia mea, quæram tibi requiem et providebo, ut bene sit tibi.
This Boaz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor.
Booz propinquus noster, cuius puellis in agro iuncta eras, ecce ipse hac nocte aream hordei ventilat.
Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the man see thee, till he shall have done eating and drinking.
Lavare igitur, ungere et induere pallio tuo ac descende in aream; non te videat homo, donec esum potumque finierit.
And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.
Quando autem ierit ad dormiendum, nota locum, in quo dormiat; veniesque et discooperies pallium, quo operitur a parte pedum, et ibi iacebis. Ipse autem dicet tibi quid agere debeas.
She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.
Quæ respondit: Quidquid præceperis, faciam.
And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her.
Descenditque in aream et fecit omnia, quæ sibi imperaverat socrus.
And when Boaz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his feet, laid herself down.
Cumque comedisset Booz et bibisset et factus esset hilarior issetque ad dormiendum in extrema parte acervi manipulorum, venit abscondite et, discooperto a pedibus eius pallio, se proiecit.
And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a woman lying at his feet.
Et ecce, nocte iam media, expavit homo et erexit se viditque mulierem iacentem ad pedes suos.
He said he would call tomorrow.
Dixit se cras appellaturum esse.
And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.
Et ait illi: “Quæ es?” Illaque respondit: “Ego sum Ruth ancilla tua. Expande pallium tuum super famulam tuam, quia tibi est ius redemptionis”.
And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich.
Et ille: Benedicta, inquit, es a Domino, filia; et priorem pietatem posteriore superasti, quia non es secuta iuvenes pauperes sive divites.
It's not a disease.
Non est morbus.
Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a virtuous woman.
Noli ergo metuere, sed, quidquid dixeris mihi, faciam tibi; scit enim omnis populus, qui habitat intra portas urbis meæ, mulierem te esse fortem.
Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.
Nec abnuo me propinquum, sed est alius me propinquior.
Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, so the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.
Quiesce hac nocte et, facto mane, si te voluerit propinquitatis iure suscipere, bene, suscipiat; sin autem ille noluerit, vivit Dominus, ego te absque ulla dubitatione suscipiam! Dormi usque mane.
So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one another, and Boaz said: Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither.
Dormivit itaque ad pedes eius usque ad noctis abscessum. Surrexitque, antequam homines se cognoscerent mutuo, et dixit Booz: Cave, ne quis noverit quod huc veneris.
And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it, and went into the city,
Et rursum: “Expande, inquit, palliolum tuum, quo operiris, et tene utraque manu”. Qua extendente et tenente, mensus est sex modios hordei et posuit super eam; quæ portans ingressa est civitatem.
When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?"
Et venit ad socrum suam. Quæ dixit ei: Quid egisti, filia?
In the end he achieved his goal.
Postremo propositum suum consecutus est.
She told her all that the man had done for her. She said, "He gave me these six measures of barley; for he said, 'Don't go empty to your mother-in-law.'"
Narravitque ei omnia, quæ sibi fecisset homo, et ait: Ecce sex modios hordei dedit mihi et ait: “Nolo vacuam te reverti ad socrum tuam”.
His mother is worried about him.
Mater eius sollicita de eo est.
Then she said, "Wait, my daughter, until you know what will happen; for the man will not rest until he has settled this today."
Dixitque Noemi: Exspecta, filia, donec videamus quem res exitum habeat; neque enim cessabit homo, nisi compleverit hodie, quod locutus est.
Do you know what to say?
Scisne quid dicere?
May God show us a better life!
Utinam Deus nobis vitam meliorem monstret!
Where's your friend?
Ubi amicus tuus?
Where's your friend?
Ubi amica tua?
I was very careful.
Diligentissimus eram.
I was very careful.
Diligentissima eram.
Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by. Boaz said to him, "Come over here, friend, and sit down!" He came over, and sat down.
Ascendit ergo Booz ad portam et sedit ibi. Cumque vidisset propinquum præterire, de quo locutus erat, dixit ad eum: “Declina paulisper et sede hic”, vocans eum nomine suo. Qui divertit et sedit.
And Boaz, taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said to them: Sit ye down here.
Tollens autem Booz decem viros de senioribus civitatis dixit ad eos: Sedete hic.
They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned from the country of Moab will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
Quibus sedentibus, locutus est ad propinquum: Partem agri fratris nostri Elimelech vendit Noemi, quæ reversa est de regione Moabitide.
I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it, and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.
"Quod audire te volui et tibi dicere: Coram cunctis sedentibus et maioribus natu de populo meo, si vis possidere iure propinquitatis, eme et posside; sin autem tibi displicet, hoc ipsum indica mihi, ut sciam quid facere debeam. Nullus est enim propinquus, excepto te, qui prior es, et me, qui secundus sum”. At ille respondit: “Ego agrum emam”.
Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabite, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance."
Cui dixit Booz: Quando emeris agrum de manu Noemi, Ruth quoque Moabitidem, quæ uxor defuncti fuit, debes accipere, ut suscites nomen defuncti propinqui tui in hereditate sua.
The near kinsman said, "I can't redeem it for myself, lest I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't redeem it."
Qui respondit: Cedo iure propinquitatis; neque enim possessionem familiæ meæ delere debeo. Tu meo utere privilegio, quo me libenter carere profiteor.
Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of formalizing transactions in Israel. So the near kinsman said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself," then he took off his sandal.
Hic autem erat mos antiquitus in Israel pro redemptione et commutatione: ut esset firma concessio, solvebat homo calceamentum suum et dabat proximo suo. Hoc erat testimonium cessionis in Israel. Dixit ergo propinquus ad Booz: “Eme tibi”. Et solvit calceamentum suum de pede suo.
And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and Chelion's, and Mahalon's, of the hand of Noemi.
Et Booz maioribus natu et universo populo: Testes, inquit, vos estis hodie quod acquisierim omnia, quæ fuerunt Elimelech et Chelion et Mahalon, tradente Noemi.
And have taken to wife Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.
Et etiam Ruth Moabitidem uxorem Mahalon in coniugium sumpserim, ut suscitem nomen defuncti in hereditate sua, ne vocabulum eius de fratribus suis et de porta loci sui deleatur. Vos, inquam, huius rei hodie testes estis.
All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which both built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem. Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the offspring which the Lord will give you by this young woman."
Respondit omnis populus, qui erat in porta, et maiores natu: Nos testes sumus; faciat Dominus hanc mulierem, quæ ingreditur domum tuam, sicut Rachel et Liam, quæ ædificaverunt ambæ domum Israel. Fortiter age in Ephratha et fac tibi celebre nomen in Bethlehem! Fiatque domus tua sicut domus Phares, quem Thamar peperit Iudæ, de semine, quod dederit Dominus tibi ex hac puella!
Boaz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.
Tulit itaque Booz Ruth et accepit uxorem; ingressusque est ad eam, et dedit illi Dominus, ut conciperet et pareret filium.
And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor: that his name should be preserved in Israel.
Dixeruntque mulieres ad Noemi: Benedictus Dominus, qui non est passus, ut deficeret tibi hodie, qui redimit familiam tuam, et vocetur nomen eius in Israel.
And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.
Et consoletur animam tuam et enutriat senectutem; de nuru enim tua natus est, quæ te diligit et multo tibi est melior quam septem filii.
And Noemi taking the child, laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.
Susceptumque Noemi puerum posuit in sinu suo et gerulæ officio fungebatur.
And the women, her neighbours, congratulating with her, and saying, There is a son born to Noemi, called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.
Vicinæ autem mulieres congratulantes ei et dicentes: “Natus est filius Noemi!”, vocaverunt nomen eius Obed. Hic est pater Isai patris David.
Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron, and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon, and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed, and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.
Hæ sunt generationes Phares: Phares genuit Esrom, Esrom genuit Aram, Aram genuit Aminadab, Aminadab genuit Naasson, Naasson genuit Salmon, Salmon genuit Booz, Booz genuit Obed, Obed genuit Iesse, Iesse genuit David.
Tom was angry with Mary.
Thomas iratus Mariae erat.
Tom was angry at Mary.
Thomas iratus Mariae erat.
Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.
Post multum vero temporis mortuus est rex Aegypti; et ingemiscentes filii Israel propter opera vociferati sunt, ascenditque clamor eorum ad Deum ab operibus.
And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Et audivit gemitum eorum ac recordatus est fœderis, quod pepigit cum Abraham, Isaac et Iacob.
And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.
Et respexit Dominus filios Israel et apparuit eis.
Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro, his father in law, the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.
Moyses autem pascebat oves Iethro soceri sui sacerdotis Madian; cumque minasset gregem ultra desertum, venit ad montem Dei Horeb.
And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire, and was not burnt.
Apparuitque ei angelus Domini in flamma ignis de medio rubi; et videbat quod rubus arderet et non combureretur.
And Moses said: I will go, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
Dixit ergo Moyses: Vadam et videbo visionem hanc magnam, quare non comburatur rubus.
And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush. and said: Moses, Moses. And he answered: Here I am.
Cernens autem Dominus quod pergeret ad videndum, vocavit eum Deus de medio rubi et ait: “Moyses, Moyses”. Qui respondit: “Adsum”.
And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet; for the place, whereon thou standest, is holy ground.
At ille: Ne appropies, inquit, huc; solve calceamentum de pedibus tuis; locus enim, in quo stas, terra sancta est.
And he said: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face: for he durst not look at God.
Et ait: “Ego sum Deus patris tui, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus Iacob”. Abscondit Moyses faciem suam; non enim audebat aspicere contra Deum.
And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works.
Cui ait Dominus: Vidi afflictionem populi mei in Aegypto et clamorem eius audivi propter duritiam exactorum eorum.
And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Canaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite.
Et sciens dolorem eius descendi, ut liberem eum de manibus Aegyptiorum et educam de terra illa in terram bonam et spatiosam, in terram, quæ fluit lacte et melle, ad loca Chananæi et Hetthæi et Amorræi et Pherezæi et Hevæi et Iebusæi.
For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians.
Clamor ergo filiorum Israel venit ad me, vidique afflictionem eorum, qua ab Aegyptiis opprimuntur.
But come, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.
Sed veni, mittam te ad pharaonem, ut educas populum meum, filios Israel, de Aegypto.
And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
Dixitque Moyses ad Deum: Quis sum ego, ut vadam ad pharaonem et educam filios Israel de Aegypto?
And he said to him: I will be with thee; and this thou shalt have for a sign that I have sent thee: When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain.
Qui dixit ei: Ego ero tecum; et hoc habebis signum quod miserim te: cum eduxeris populum de Aegypto, servietis Deo super montem istum.
Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they shall say to me: What is his name? What shall I say to them?
Ait Moyses ad Deum: Ecce, ego vadam ad filios Israel et dicam eis: Deus patrum vestrorum misit me ad vos. Si dixerint mihi: "Quod est nomen eius?" quid dicam eis?
God said to Moses: I AM WHO AM. He said: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS, hath sent me to you.
Dixit Deus ad Moysen: “Ego sum qui sum”. Ait: “Sic dices filiis Israel: Qui sum misit me ad vos”.
And God said again to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath sent me to you; this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
Dixitque iterum Deus ad Moysen: Hæc dices filiis Israel: Dominus, Deus patrum vestrorum, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus lacob, misit me ad vos; hoc nomen mihi est in æternum, et hoc memoriale meum in generationem et generationem.
Go and gather together the ancients of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying: Visiting I have visited you; and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt.
Vade et congrega seniores Israel et dices ad eos: Dominus, Deus patrum vestrorum, apparuit mihi, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus Iacob, dicens: Visitans visitavi vos et vidi omnia, quæ acciderunt vobis in Aegypto.
And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Canaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and honey.
Et dixi: Educam vos de afflictione Aegypti in terram Chananæi et Hetthæi et Amorræi et Pherezæi et Hevæi et Iebusæi, ad terram fluentem lacte et melle.
And they shall hear thy voice; and thou shalt go in, thou and the ancients of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us; we will go three days' journey into the wilderness, to sacrifice unto the Lord our God.
Et audient vocem tuam; ingredierisque tu et seniores Israel ad regem Aegypti, et dicetis ad eum: Dominus, Deus Hebræorum, occurrit nobis; et nunc eamus viam trium dierum in solitudinem, ut immolemus Domino Deo nostro.
But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a mighty hand.
Sed ego scio quod non dimittet vos rex Aegypti, ut eatis, nisi per manum validam.
For I will stretch forth my hand, and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them: after these he will let you go.
Extendam enim manum meam et percutiam Aegyptum in cunctis mirabilibus meis, quæ facturus sum in medio eius; post hæc dimittet vos.
And I will give favour to this people, in the sight of the Egyptians: and when you go forth, you shall not depart empty. But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Egypt.
Daboque gratiam populo huic coram Aegyptiis, et, cum egrediemini, non exibitis vacui. Sed postulabit mulier a vicina sua et ab hospita sua vasa argentea et aurea ac vestes; ponetisque eas super filios et filias vestras et spoliabitis Aegyptum.
Moses answered, and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee.
Respondens Moyses ait: Quid autem, si non credent mihi neque audient vocem meam, sed dicent: "Non apparuit tibi Dominus?"
Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.
Dixit ergo ad eum: “Quid est quod tenes in manu tua?” Respondit: “Virga”.
And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent, so that Moses fled from it.
Dixitque Dominus: “Proice eam in terram!” Proiecit, et versa est in serpentem, ita ut fugeret Moyses.
And the Lord said: Put out thy hand, and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod. That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.
Dixitque Dominus: “Extende manum tuam et apprehende caudam eius!” Extendit et tenuit, versaque est in virgam. “Ut credant, inquit, quod apparuerit tibi Dominus, Deus patrum suorum, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus Iacob”.
And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.
Dixitque Dominus rursum: “Mitte manum tuam in sinum tuum!” Quam cum misisset in sinum, protulit leprosam instar nivis.
And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.
“Retrahe, ait, manum tuam in sinum tuum!” Retraxit et protulit iterum, et erat similis carni reliquæ.
If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.
Si non crediderint, inquit, tibi, neque audierint sermonem signi prioris, credent verbo signi sequentis.
But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river, shall be turned into blood.
Quod si nec duobus quidem his signis crediderint neque audierint vocem tuam, sume aquam fluminis et effunde eam super aridam, et, quidquid hauseris de fluvio, vertetur in sanguinem.
Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord, I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before; and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.
Ait Moyses: Obsecro, Domine, non sum eloquens ab heri et nudiustertius et ex quo locutus es ad servum tuum, nam impeditioris et tardioris linguæ sum.
The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I?
Dixit Dominus ad eum: Quis fecit os hominis? Aut quis fabricatus est mutum vel surdum vel videntem vel cæcum? Nonne ego?
Go therefore, and I will be in thy mouth; and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.
Perge igitur, et ego ero in ore tuo; doceboque te quid loquaris.
But he said: I beseech thee, Lord, send whom thou wilt send.
At ille: Obsecro, inquit, Domine, mitte quem missurus es.
The Lord being angry at Moses, said: Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee, shall be glad at heart.
Iratus Dominus in Moysen ait: Aaron, frater tuus Levites, scio quod eloquens sit; ecce ipse egreditur in occursum tuum vidensque te lætabitur corde.
Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what you must do.
Loquere ad eum et pone verba mea in ore eius; et ego ero in ore tuo et in ore illius et ostendam vobis quid agere debeatis.
He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.
Ipse loquetur pro te ad populum et erit os tuum; tu autem eris ei ut Deus.
And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.
Virgam quoque hanc sume in manu tua, in qua facturus es signa.
Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said to him; I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.
Abiit Moyses et reversus est ad Iethro socerum suum dixitque ei: “Vadam, quæso, et revertar ad fratres meos in Aegyptum, ut videam, si adhuc vivant”. Cui ait Iethro: “Vade in pace”.
And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt; for they are all dead that sought thy life.
Dixit ergo Dominus ad Moysen in Madian: Vade, revertere in Aegyptum; mortui sunt enim omnes, qui quærebant animam tuam.
Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass; and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.
Tulit Moyses uxorem suam et filios suos et imposuit eos super asinum; reversusque est in Aegyptum portans virgam Dei in manu sua.
And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.
Dixitque ei Dominus revertenti in Aegyptum: Vide, ut omnia ostenta, quæ posui in manu tua, facias coram pharaone; ego indurabo cor eius, et non dimittet populum.
And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn. I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.
Dicesque ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus: Filius meus primogenitus Israel. Dico tibi: Dimitte filium meum, ut serviat mihi; si autem non vis dimittere eum, ecce ego interficiam filium tuum primogenitum.
And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him.
Cumque esset in itinere, in deversorio, occurrit ei Dominus et volebat occidere eum.
A fox is a wild animal.
Vulpes est animal ferox.
Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the foreskin of her son, and touched his feet, and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.
Tulit ilico Sephora acutissimam petram et circumcidit præputium filii sui; tetigitque pedes eius et ait: Sponsus sanguinum tu mihi es.
And he let him go after she had said: A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.
Et dimisit eum, postquam dixerat: “Sponsus sanguinum”, ob circumcisionem.
Is Tom married to Mary?
Estne Thomas maritus Mariae?
And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Aaron: “Vade in occursum Moysi in desertum”. Qui perrexit obviam ei in montem Dei et osculatus est eum.
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.
Narravitque Moyses Aaron omnia verba Domini, quibus miserat eum, et signa, quæ mandaverat.
And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.
Veneruntque simul et congregaverunt cunctos seniores filiorum Israel.
And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people.
Locutusque est Aaron omnia verba, quæ dixerat Dominus ad Moysen, et fecit signa coram populo.
And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored.
Et credidit populus, audieruntque quod visitasset Dominus filios Israel et quod respexisset afflictionem eorum; et proni adoraverunt.
After these things, Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharaoh: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Let my people go, that they may sacrifice to me in the desert.
Post hæc ingressi sunt Moyses et Aaron et dixerunt pharaoni: Hæc dicit Dominus, Deus Israel: Dimitte populum meum, ut sacrificet mihi in deserto.
But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.
At ille respondit: Quis est Dominus, ut audiam vocem eius et dimittam Israel? Nescio Dominum et Israel non dimittam.
And they said: The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three days' journey into the wilderness, and to sacrifice to the Lord our God; lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.
Dixeruntque: Deus Hebræorum occurrit nobis; eamus, quæso, viam trium dierum in solitudinem et sacrificemus Domino Deo nostro, ne forte accidat nobis pestis aut gladius.
The king of Egypt said to them: Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to your burdens.
Ait ad eos rex Aegypti: Quare, Moyses et Aaron, sollicitatis populum ab operibus suis? Ite ad onera vestra.
And Pharaoh said: The people of the land are numerous; you see that the multitude is increased; how much more if you give them rest from their works?
Dixitque pharao: Multus nimis iam est populus terræ; videtis quod turba succreverit; quanto magis si dederitis eis requiem ab operibus?
Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the task-masters of the people, saying: You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as before; but let them go and gather straw.
Præcepit ergo in die illo exactoribus populi et præfectis eius dicens: Nequaquam ultra dabitis paleas populo ad conficiendos lateres sicut prius, sed ipsi vadant et colligant stipulas.
And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before; neither shall you diminish any thing thereof, for they are idle, and therefore they cry. saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
Et mensuram laterum, quam prius faciebant, imponetis super eos; nec minuetis quidquam. Vacant enim et idcirco vociferantur dicentes: Eamus et sacrificemus Deo nostro.
Let them be oppressed with works, and let them fulfil them; that they may not regard lying words.
Opprimantur operibus et expleant ea, ut non acquiescant verbis mendacibus.
And the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters, went out and said to the people: Thus saith Pharaoh: I allow you no straw; go, and gather it where you can find it; neither shall any thing of your work be diminished.
Igitur egressi exactores populi et præfecti eius dixerunt ad populum: Sic dicit pharao: "Non do vobis paleas. Ite et colligite, sicubi invenire poteritis, nec minuetur quidquam de opere vestro."
And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather straw.
Dispersusque est populus per omnem terram Aegypti ad colligendas paleas.
And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying: Fulfil your work every day, as before ye were wont to do, when straw was given you.
Exactores quoque instabant dicentes: Complete opus vestrum cotidie, ut prius facere solebatis, quando dabantur vobis paleæ.
And they that were over the works of the children of Israel, were scourged by Pharaoh's taskmasters, saying: Why have you not made up the task of bricks, both yesterday and today, as before?
Flagellatique sunt præfecti filiorum Israel, quos constituerant super eos exactores pharaonis dicentes: Quare non implestis mensuram laterum sicut prius, nec heri nec hodie?
And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to Pharaoh, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy servants?
Veneruntque præfecti filiorum Israel et vociferati sunt ad pharaonem dicentes: Cur ita agis contra servos tuos?
Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before; behold we, thy servants, are beaten with whips, and thy people is unjustly dealt withal.
Paleæ non dantur nobis, et lateres similiter imperantur; en famuli tui flagellis cædimur, et populus tuus est in culpa.
And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.
Qui ait: Vacatis otio et idcirco dicitis: "Eamus et sacrificemus Domino".
Go therefore and work: straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks.
Ite ergo et operamini; paleæ non dabuntur vobis, et reddetis consuetum numerum laterum.
And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, because it was said to them: There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day.
Videbantque se præfecti filiorum Israel in malo, eo quod diceretur eis: Non minuetur quidquam de lateribus per singulos dies.
And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they came out from Pharaoh, and they said to them: The Lord see and judge, because you have made our savour to stink before Pharaoh and his servants, and you have given him a sword, to kill us.
Occurreruntque Moysi et Aaron, qui stabant ex adverso egredientibus a pharaone, et dixerunt ad eos: Videat Dominus et iudicet, quoniam fœtere fecistis odorem nostrum coram pharaone et servis eius; et præbuistis ei gladium, ut occideret nos.
I wrote Mary a letter.
Epistulam Mariae scripsi.
And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou sent me? For since the time that I went in to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not delivered them.
Reversusque est Moyses ad Dominum et ait: Domine, cur afflixisti populum istum? Quare misisti me? Ex eo enim quo ingressus sum ad pharaonem, ut loquerer in nomine tuo, afflixit populum tuum; et non liberasti eos.
Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen: Nunc videbis quæ facturus sim pharaoni; per manum enim fortem dimittet eos et in manu robusta eiciet illos de terra sua.
And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Erat autem Moyses octoginta annorum, et Aaron octoginta trium, quando locuti sunt ad pharaonem.
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: When Pharaoh shall say to you, Shew signs; thou shalt say to Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, and it shall be turned into a serpent.
Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron: Cum dixerit vobis pharao: "Ostendite signum", dices ad Aaron: Tolle virgam tuam et proice eam coram pharaone, ac vertetur in colubrum.
So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and did as the Lord had commanded. And Aaron took the rod before Pharaoh and his servants, and it was turned into a serpent.
Ingressi itaque Moyses et Aaron ad pharaonem fecerunt, sicut præceperat Dominus; proiecitque Aaron virgam coram pharaone et servis eius, quæ versa est in colubrum.
And Pharaoh called the wise men and the magicians; and they also by Egyptian enchantments and certain secrets, did in like manner. And they every one cast down their rods, and they were turned into serpents: but Aaron's rod devoured their rods.
Vocavit autem pharao sapientes et maleficos, et fecerunt etiam ipsi magi Aegypti per incantationes suas similiter. Proieceruntque singuli virgas suas, quæ versæ sunt in colubros; sed devoravit virga Aaron virgas eorum.
And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as the Lord had commanded.
Induratumque est cor pharaonis, et non audivit eos, sicut dixerat Dominus.
And the Lord said to Moses: Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he will not let the people go.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Ingravatum est cor pharaonis: non vult dimittere populum.
Go to him in the morning, behold he will go out to the waters: and thou shalt stand to meet him on the bank of the river: and thou shalt take in thy hand the rod that was turned into a serpent. And thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews sent me to thee, saying: Let my people go to sacrifice to me in the desert: and hitherto thou wouldst not hear.
Vade ad eum mane. Ecce egredietur ad aquas; et stabis in occursum eius super ripam fluminis. Et virgam, quæ conversa est in serpentem, tolles in manu tua dicesque ad eum: Dominus, Deus Hebræorum, misit me ad te dicens: Dimitte populum meum, ut sacrificet mihi in deserto; et usque ad præsens audire noluisti.
Thus therefore saith the Lord: In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold I will strike with the rod, that is in my hand, the water of the river, and it shall be turned into blood.
Hæc igitur dicit Dominus: In hoc scies quod sim Dominus: ecce percutiam virga, quæ in manu mea est, aquam fluminis; et vertetur in sanguinem.
And the fishes that are in the river shall die, and the waters shall be corrupted, and the Egyptians shall be afflicted when they drink the water of the river.
Pisces quoque, qui sunt in fluvio, morientur, et computrescent aquæ, et tædebit Aegyptios bibere aquam fluminis.
The Lord also said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Take thy rod; and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon their rivers, and streams and pools, and all the ponds of waters, that they may be turned into blood: and let blood be in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of stone.
Dixit quoque Dominus ad Moysen: Dic ad Aaron: Tolle virgam tuam et extende manum tuam super aquas Aegypti, super fluvios eorum et rivos ac paludes et omnes lacus aquarum, ut vertantur in sanguinem; et sit cruor in omni terra Aegypti, tam in ligneis vasis quam in saxeis.
And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: and lifting up the rod, he struck the water of the river before Pharaoh and his servants: and it was turned into blood.
Feceruntque ita Moyses et Aaron, sicut præceperat Dominus. Et elevans virgam percussit aquam fluminis coram pharaone et servis eius; quæ versa est in sanguinem.
Why should I give you money?
Cur debeo dare pecuniam tibi?
And the fishes that were in the river died; and the river corrupted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood in all the land of Egypt.
Et pisces, qui erant in flumine, mortui sunt, computruitque fluvius, et non poterant Aegyptii bibere aquam fluminis; et fuit sanguis in tota terra Aegypti.
And the magicians of the Egyptians with their enchantments did in like manner; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hear them, as the Lord had commanded.
Feceruntque similiter malefici Aegyptiorum incantationibus suis; et induratum est cor pharaonis, nec audivit eos, sicut dixerat Dominus.
And he turned himself away, and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to it this time also.
Avertitque se et ingressus est domum suam nec ad hoc apposuit cor suum.
And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
Foderunt autem omnes Aegyptii per circuitum fluminis aquam, ut biberent; non enim poterant bibere de aqua fluminis.
And seven days were fully ended, after that the Lord struck the river. And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharaoh, and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Let my people go to sacrifice to me. But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will strike all thy coasts with frogs.
Impletique sunt septem dies, postquam percussit Dominus fluvium. Dixit quoque Dominus ad Moysen: Ingredere ad pharaonem et dices ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus: "Dimitte populum meum, ut sacrificet mihi. Sin autem nolueris dimittere, ecce ego percutiam omnes terminos tuos ranis."
And the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs; which shall come up and enter into thy house, and thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the houses of thy servants, and to thy people, and into thy ovens, and into the remains of thy meats. And the frogs shall come in to thee, and to thy people, and to all thy servants.
Et ebulliet fluvius ranas, quæ ascendent et ingredientur domum tuam et cubiculum lectuli tui et super stratum tuum et in domos servorum tuorum et in populum tuum et in furnos tuos et in pistrina tua; et ad te et ad populum tuum et ad omnes servos tuos intrabunt ranæ.
And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron: Stretch forth thy hand upon the streams, and upon the rivers and the pools, and bring forth frogs upon the land of Egypt. .
Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen: Dic ad Aaron: Extende manum tuam cum baculo tuo super fluvios, super rivos ac paludes et educ ranas super terram Aegypti.
And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
Et extendit Aaron manum super aquas Aegypti, et ascenderunt ranæ operueruntque terram Aegypti.
And the magicians also, by their enchantments, did in like manner, and they brought forth frogs upon the land of Egypt.
Fecerunt autem et malefici per incantationes suas similiter eduxeruntque ranas super terram Aegypti.
But Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Pray ye to the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.
Vocavit autem pharao Moysen et Aaron et dixit: Orate Dominum, ut auferat ranas a me et a populo meo, et dimittam populum, ut sacrificet Domino.
And Moses said to Pharaoh: Set me a time when I shall pray for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; and may remain only in the river.
Dixitque Moyses ad pharaonem: Constitue mihi, quando deprecer pro te et pro servis et pro populo tuo, ut abigantur ranæ a te et a domo tua et tantum in flumine remaneant.
And he answered: To morrow. But he said: I will do according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like to the Lord our God.
Qui respondit: “Cras”. At ille: “Iuxta verbum, inquit, tuum faciam, ut scias quoniam non est sicut Dominus Deus noster. Et recedent ranæ a te et a domo tua et a servis tuis et a populo tuo; tantum in flumine remanebunt”.
And Moses and Aaron went forth from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the Lord for the promise, which he had made to Pharaoh concerning the frogs.
Egressique sunt Moyses et Aaron a pharaone; et clamavit Moyses ad Dominum pro sponsione ranarum, quam condixerat pharaoni.
And the Lord did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields. And they gathered them together into immense heaps, and the land was corrupted.
Fecitque Dominus iuxta verbum Moysi, et mortuæ sunt ranæ de domibus et de villis et de agris; congregaveruntque eas in immensos aggeres, et computruit terra.
And Pharaoh seeing that rest was given, hardened his own heart, and did not hear them, as the Lord had commanded.
Videns autem pharao quod data esset requies, ingravavit cor suum et non audivit eos, sicut dixerat Dominus.
And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron: Stretch forth thy rod, and strike the dust of the earth; and may there be sciniphs in all the land of Egypt.
Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen: Loquere ad Aaron: Extende virgam tuam et percute pulverem terræ, et sint scinifes in universa terra Aegypti.
And they did so. And Aaron stretched forth his hand, holding the rod; and he struck the dust of the earth, and there came sciniphs on men and on beasts: all the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphs through all the land of Egypt.
Feceruntque ita; et extendit Aaron manum virgam tenens percussitque pulverem terræ. Et facti sunt scinifes in hominibus et in iumentis; omnis pulvis terræ versus est in scinifes per totam terram Aegypti.
And the magicians with their enchantments practised in like manner, to bring forth sciniphs, and they could not: and there were sciniphs as well on men as on beasts.
Feceruntque similiter malefici incantationibus suis, ut educerent scinifes; et non potuerunt. Erantque scinifes tam in hominibus quam in iumentis.
And the magicians said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had commanded.
Et dixerunt malefici ad pharaonem: “Digitus Dei est hic”. Induratumque est cor pharaonis et non audivit eos, sicut præceperat Dominus.
The Lord also said to Moses: Arise early, and stand before Pharaoh; for he will go forth to the waters: and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.
Dixit quoque Dominus ad Moysen: Consurge diluculo et sta coram pharaone. Egredietur enim ad aquas, et dices ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus: Dimitte populum meum, ut sacrificet mihi.
But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will send in upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy houses, all kind of flies: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with flies of divers kinds, and the whole land wherein they shall be.
Quod si non dimiseris eum, ecce ego immittam in te et in servos tuos et in populum tuum et in domos tuas omne genus muscarum; et implebuntur domus Aegyptiorum muscis et etiam humus, in qua fuerint.
And I will make the land of Goshen wonderful in that day, so that flies shall not be there: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth. And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.
Et segregabo in die illa terram Goshen, in qua populus meus est, ut non sint ibi muscæ, et scias quoniam ego Dominus in medio terræ; ponamque divisionem inter populum meum et populum tuum; cras erit signum istud.
OK, I'm ready.
Bene, paratus sum.
OK, I'm ready.
Bene, parata sum.
And the Lord did so. And there came a very grievous swarm of flies into the houses of Pharaoh and of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt: and the land was corrupted by this kind of flies.
Fecitque Dominus ita; et venit musca gravissima in domos pharaonis et servorum eius et in omnem terram Aegypti, corruptaque est terra ab huiuscemodi muscis.
And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Go and sacrifice to your God in this land.
Vocavitque pharao Moysen et Aaron et ait eis: Ite, sacrificate Deo vestro in terra.
And Moses said: It cannot be so: for we shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: now if we kill those things which the Egyptians worship, in their presence, they will stone us.
Et ait Moyses: Non potest ita fieri: abominationes enim Aegyptiorum immolabimus Domino Deo nostro; quod si mactaverimus ea, quæ colunt Aegyptii, coram eis, lapidibus nos obruent.
We will go three days' journey into the wilderness; and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.
Viam trium dierum pergemus in solitudinem et sacrificabimus Domino Deo nostro, sicut præcepit nobis.
And Pharaoh said: I will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness, but go no farther: pray for me.
Dixitque pharao: Ego dimittam vos, ut sacrificetis Domino Deo vestro in deserto, verumtamen longius ne abeatis; rogate pro me.
And Moses said: I will go out from thee, and will pray to the Lord: and the flies shall depart from Pharaoh, and from his servants, and from his people to morrow: but do not deceive any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.
Et ait Moyses: Egressus a te, orabo Dominum, et recedet musca a pharaone et a servis suis et a populo eius cras; verumtamen noli ultra fallere, ut non dimittas populum sacrificare Domino.
So Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to the Lord. And he did according to his word: and he took away the flies from Pharaoh, and from his servants, and from his people: there was not left so much as one.
Egressusque Moyses a pharaone oravit Dominum; qui fecit iuxta verbum illius et abstulit muscas a pharaone et a servis suis et a populo eius; non superfuit ne una quidem.
And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, so that neither this time would he let the people go.
Et ingravatum est cor pharaonis, ita ut ne hac quidem vice dimitteret populum.
And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharaoh, and speak to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Ingredere ad pharaonem et loquere ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus, Deus Hebræorum: Dimitte populum meum, ut sacrificet mihi.
But if thou refuse, and withhold them still: Behold my hand shall be upon thy fields; and a very grievous murrain upon thy horses, and asses, and camels, and oxen, and sheep.
Quod si adhuc renuis et retines eos, ecce manus Domini erit super possessionem tuam in agris, super equos et asinos et camelos et boves et oves, pestis valde gravis.
And the Lord will make a wonderful difference between the possessions of Israel and the possessions of the Egyptians, that nothing at all shall die of those things that belong to the children of Israel.
Et distinguet Dominus inter possessiones Israel et possessiones Aegyptiorum, ut nihil omnino pereat ex his, quæ pertinent ad filios Israel.
And the Lord appointed a time, saying: To morrow will the Lord do this thing in the land.
Constituitque Dominus tempus dicens: Cras faciet Dominus verbum istud in terra.
And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.
Erant autem sacerdoti Madian septem filiæ, quæ venerunt ad hauriendam aquam; et impletis canalibus adaquare cupiebant greges patris sui.
But Dad won't like it.
Id autem Tatae non placebit.
The Lord therefore did this thing the next day: and all the beasts of the Egyptians died, but of the beasts of the children of Israel there died not one.
Fecit ergo Dominus verbum hoc altera die, mortuaque sunt omnia animantia Aegyptiorum; de animalibus vero filiorum Israel nihil omnino periit.
And Pharaoh sent to see; and there was not any thing dead of that which Israel possessed. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
Et misit pharao ad videndum; nec erat quidquam mortuum de his, quæ possidebat Israel. Ingravatumque est cor pharaonis, et non dimisit populum.

And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Take to you handfuls of ashes out of the chimney, and let Moses sprinkle it in the air in the presence of Pharaoh.
Et dixit Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron: Tollite plenas manus cineris de camino, et spargat illum Moyses in cælum coram pharaone.
And be there dust upon all the land of Egypt: for there shall be boils and swelling blains both in men and beasts, in the whole land of Egypt.
Sitque pulvis super omnem terram Aegypti; erunt enim in hominibus et iumentis ulcera et vesicæ turgentes in universa terra Aegypti.
And they took ashes out of the chimney, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it in the air; and there came boils with swelling blains in men and beasts.
Tuleruntque cinerem de camino et steterunt coram pharaone, et sparsit illum Moyses in cælum; factaque sunt ulcera vesicarum turgentium in hominibus et iumentis.
Neither could the magicians stand before Moses, for the boils that were upon them, and in all the land of Egypt.
Nec poterant malefici stare coram Moyse propter ulcera, quæ in illis erant et in omni terra Aegypti.
And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.
Induravitque Dominus cor pharaonis, et non audivit eos, sicut locutus est Dominus ad Moysen.
And the Lord said to Moses: Arise in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.
Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen: Mane consurge et sta coram pharaone et dices ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus, Deus Hebræorum: Dimitte populum meum, ut sacrificet mihi.
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayst know that there is none like me in all the earth.
Quia in hac vice mittam omnes plagas meas super cor tuum et super servos tuos et super populum tuum, ut scias quod non sit similis mei in omni terra.
For now I will stretch out my hand to strike thee, and thy people, with pestilence, and thou shalt perish from the earth.
Nunc enim extendens manum si percussissem te et populum tuum peste, perisses de terra.
And therefore have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and my name may be spoken of throughout all the earth.
Idcirco autem servavi te, ut ostendam in te fortitudinem meam, et narretur nomen meum in omni terra.
Dost thou yet hold back my people; and wilt thou not let them go? Behold I will cause it to rain to morrow at this same hour, an exceeding great hail; such as hath not been in Egypt from the day that it was founded, until this present time.
Adhuc retines populum meum et non vis dimittere eum? En pluam cras, hac ipsa hora, grandinem multam nimis, qualis non fuit in Aegypto a die, qua fundata est, usque in præsens tempus.
Send therefore now presently, and gather together thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for men and beasts, and all things that shall be found abroad, and not gathered together out of the fields which the hail shall fall upon, shall die.
Mitte ergo iam nunc et congrega iumenta tua et omnia, quæ habes in agro; homines enim et iumenta universa, quæ inventa fuerint foris nec congregata de agris, cadet super ea grando, et morientur.
He that feared the word of the Lord among Pharaoh's servants, made his servants and his cattle flee into houses. But he that regarded not the word of the Lord, left his servants, and his cattle in the fields.
Qui timuit verbum Domini de servis pharaonis, fecit confugere servos suos et iumenta in domos; qui autem neglexit sermonem Domini, dimisit servos suos et iumenta in agris.
And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in the whole land of Egypt upon men, and upon beasts, and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt.
Et dixit Dominus ad Moysen: Extende manum tuam in cælum, ut fiat grando in universa terra Aegypti super homines et super iumenta et super omnem herbam agri in terra Aegypti.
And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and lightnings running along the ground: and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
Extenditque Moyses virgam in cælum, et Dominus dedit tonitrua et grandinem ac discurrentia fulgura super terram; pluitque Dominus grandinem super terram Aegypti.
Tom was with his friends.

And the hail and fire mixt with it drove on together: and it was of so great bigness, as never before was seen in the whole land of Egypt since that nation was founded.
Et grando et ignis immixta pariter ferebantur; tantæque fuit magnitudinis, quanta ante numquam apparuit in universa terra Aegypti, ex quo gens illa condita est.
And the hail destroyed through all the land of Egypt all things that were in the fields, both man and beast: and the hail smote every herb of the field, and it broke every tree of the country.
Et percussit grando in omni terra Aegypti cuncta, quæ fuerunt in agris, ab homine usque ad iumentum; cunctamque herbam agri percussit grando et omne lignum regionis confregit.
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, the hail fell not.
Tantum in terra Gessen, ubi erant filii Israel, grando non cecidit.
And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron, saying to them: I have sinned this time also, the Lord is just: I and my people, are wicked.
Misitque pharao et vocavit Moysen et Aaron dicens ad eos: Nunc peccavi; Dominus iustus, ego et populus meus rei.

Pray ye to the Lord that the thunderings of God and the hail may cease: that I may let you go, and that ye may stay here no longer.
Orate Dominum, ut desinant tonitrua Dei et grando, et dimittam vos, et nequaquam hic ultra manebitis.
Moses said: As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will stretch forth my hands to the Lord, and the thunders shall cease, and the hail shall be no more: that thou mayst know that the earth is the Lord's.
Ait Moyses: Cum egressus fuero de urbe, extendam palmas meas ad Dominum; et cessabunt tonitrua, et grando non erit, ut scias quia Domini est terra.

The flax therefore, and the barley were hurt, because the barley was green, and the flax was now bolled; but the wheat, and other winter corn were not hurt, because they were lateward.
Linum ergo et hordeum læsum est, eo quod hordeum iam spicas et linum iam folliculos germinaret; triticum autem et far non sunt læsa, quia serotina erant.
And when Moses was gone from Pharaoh out of the city, he stretched forth his hands to the Lord: and the thunders and the hail ceased, neither did there drop any more rain upon the earth.
Egressusque Moyses a pharaone ex urbe tetendit manus ad Dominum; et cessaverunt tonitrua et grando, nec ultra effundebatur pluvia super terram.
And Pharaoh seeing that the rain, and the hail, and the thunders were ceased, increased his sin: and his heart was hardened, and the heart of his servants, and it was made exceeding hard: neither did he let the children of Israel go, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses.
Videns autem pharao quod cessasset pluvia et grando et tonitrua, auxit peccatum; et ingravatum est cor eius et servorum illius et induratum nimis; nec dimisit filios Israel, sicut dixerat Dominus per manum Moysi.
And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants: that I may work these my signs in him, and thou mayst tell in the ears of thy sons, and of thy grandsons, how often I have plagued the Egyptians, and wrought my signs amongst them: and you may know that I am the Lord.
Et dixit Dominus ad Moysen: Ingredere ad pharaonem: ego enim induravi cor eius et servorum illius, ut faciam signa mea hæc in medio eorum, et narres in auribus filii tui et nepotum tuorum, quotiens contriverim Aegyptios et signa mea fecerim in eis; et sciatis quia ego Dominus.
Therefore Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: How long refusest thou to submit to me? let my people go, to sacrifice to me.
Introierunt ergo Moyses et Aaron ad pharaonem et dixerunt ei: Hæc dicit Dominus, Deus Hebræorum: Usquequo non vis subici mihi? Dimitte populum meum, ut sacrificet mihi.
But if thou resist, and wilt not let them go, behold I will bring in to-morrow the locusts into thy coasts, to cover the face of the earth, that nothing thereof may appear, but that which the hail hath left may be eaten: for they shall feed upon all the trees that spring in the fields.
Sin autem resistis et non vis dimittere eum, ecce ego inducam cras locustam in fines tuos, quæ operiat superficiem terræ, ne quidquam eius appareat, sed comedatur, quod residuum fuerit grandini; corrodet enim omnia ligna, quæ germinant in agris.
And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants, and of all the Egyptians: such a number as thy fathers have not seen, nor thy grandfathers, from the time they were first upon the earth, until this present day. And he turned himself away, and went forth from Pharaoh.
"Et implebunt domos tuas et servorum tuorum et omnium Aegyptiorum, quantam non viderunt patres tui et avi, ex quo orti sunt super terram usque in præsentem diem”. Avertitque se et egressus est a pharaone.
Maybe later.
Fortasse postea.
And Pharaoh's servants said to him: How long shall we endure this scandal? Iet the men go to sacrifice to the Lord their God. Dost thou not see that Egypt is undone?
Dixerunt autem servi pharaonis ad eum: Usquequo patiemur hoc scandalum? Dimitte homines, ut sacrificent Domino Deo suo; nonne vides quod perierit Aegyptus?
And they called back Moses, and Aaron, to Pharaoh; and he said to them: Go, sacrifice to the Lord your God: who are they that shall go?
Revocaveruntque Moysen et Aaron ad pharaonem, qui dixit eis: Ite, sacrificate Domino Deo vestro. Quinam sunt qui ituri sunt?
Moses said: We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, with our sheep and herds: for it is the solemnity of the Lord our God.
Ait Moyses: Cum parvulis nostris et senioribus pergemus, cum filiis et filiabus, cum ovibus et armentis; est enim sollemnitas Domini nobis.
And Pharaoh answered: So be the Lord with you, as I shall let you and your children go: who can doubt but that you intend some great evil? It shall not be so, but go ye men only, and sacrifice to the Lord: for this yourselves also desired. And immediately they were cast out from Pharaoh's presence.
Et respondit eis: “Sic Dominus sit vobiscum, quomodo ego dimittam vos et parvulos vestros. Cui dubium est quod pessime cogitetis? Non fiet ita, sed ite tantum viri et sacrificate Domino; hoc enim et ipsi petistis”. Statimque eiecti sunt de conspectu pharaonis.
And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt unto the locust, that it come upon it, and devour every herb that is left after the hail.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Extende manum tuam super terram Aegypti, ut veniat locusta et ascendat super eam et devoret omnem herbam, quidquid residuum fuerit grandini.
And Moses stretched forth his rod upon the land of Egypt: and the Lord brought a burning wind all that day, and night; and when it was morning, the burning wind raised the locusts. And they came up over the whole land of Egypt; and rested in all the coasts of the Egyptians, innumerable, the like as had not been before that time, nor shall be hereafter.
Et extendit Moyses virgam super terram Aegypti, et Dominus induxit ventum urentem tota die illa et nocte. Et mane facto, ventus urens levavit locustas; quæ ascenderunt super universam terram Aegypti et sederunt in cunctis finibus Aegyptiorum innumerabiles, quales ante illud tempus non fuerant nec postea futuræ sunt.
And they covered the whole face of the earth, wasting all things. And the grass of the earth was devoured, and what fruits soever were on the trees, which the hail had left; and there remained not any thing that was green on the trees, or in the herbs of the earth, in all Egypt.
Operueruntque universam superficiem terræ , et obscurata est terra. Devoraverunt igitur omnem herbam terræ et, quidquid pomorum in arboribus fuit, quæ grando dimiserat; nihilque omnino virens relictum est in lignis et in herbis terræ in cuncta Aegypto.
Wherefore Pharaoh in haste called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you. But now forgive me my sin this time also, and pray to the Lord your God, that he take away from me this death.
Quam ob rem festinus pharao vocavit Moysen et Aaron et dixit eis: Peccavi in Dominum Deum vestrum et in vos. Sed nunc dimittite peccatum mihi tantum hac vice et rogate Dominum Deum vestrum, ut auferat a me saltem mortem istam.
And Moses going forth from the presence of Pharaoh, prayed to the Lord. And he made a very strong wind to blow from the west, and it took the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea: there remained not so much as one in all the coasts of Egypt.
Egressusque Moyses de conspectu pharaonis oravit Dominum, qui flare fecit ventum ab occidente vehementissimum et arreptam locustam proiecit in mare Rubrum; non remansit ne una quidem in cunctis finibus Aegypti.
And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, neither did he let the children of Israel go.
Et induravit Dominus cor pharaonis, nec dimisit filios Israel.
And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch out thy hand towards heaven: and may there be darkness upon the land of Egypt so thick that it may be felt.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Extende manum tuam in cælum, et sint tenebræ super terram Aegypti tam densæ ut palpari queant.
And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven: and there came horrible darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
Extenditque Moyses manum in cælum, et factæ sunt tenebræ horribiles in universa terra Aegypti tribus diebus.
No man saw his brother, nor moved himself out of the place where he was: but wheresoever the children of Israel dwelt, there was light.
Nemo vidit fratrem suum nec movit se de loco, in quo erat. Ubicumque autem habitabant filii Israel, lux erat.
And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Go, sacrifice to the Lord: let your sheep only, and herds remain, let your children go with you.
Vocavitque pharao Moysen et Aaron et dixit eis: Ite, sacrificate Domino; oves tantum vestræ et armenta remaneant, parvuli vestri eant vobiscum.
Moses said: Thou shalt give us also sacrifices and burnt-offerings, to the Lord our God. All the flocks shall go with us; there shall not a hoof remain of them: for they are necessary for the service of the Lord our God: especially as we know not what must be offered, till we come to the very place.
Ait Moyses: Etiamsi tu hostias et holocausta dares nobis, quæ offeramus Domino Deo nostro, tamen et greges nostri pergent nobiscum; non remanebit ex eis ungula, quoniam ex ipsis sumemus, quæ necessaria sunt in cultum Domini Dei nostri; præsertim cum ignoremus quid debeat immolari, donec ad ipsum locum perveniamus.
And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
Induravit autem Dominus cor pharaonis, et noluit dimittere eos.
And Pharaoh said to Moses: Get thee from me, and beware thou see not my face any more: in what day soever thou shalt come in my sight, thou shalt die.
Dixitque pharao ad eum: Recede a me. Cave, ne ultra videas faciem meam; quocumque die apparueris mihi, morieris.
Moses answered: So shall it be as thou hast spoken, I will not see thy face anymore.
Respondit Moyses: Ita fiet, ut locutus es; non videbo ultra faciem tuam.
And the Lord said to Moses: Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt, and after that he shall let you go, and thrust you out.
Et dixit Dominus ad Moysen: Adhuc una plaga tangam pharaonem et Aegyptum, et post hæc dimittet vos utique, immo et exire compellet.

Therefore thou shalt tell all the people, that every man ask of his friend, and every woman of her neighbour, vessels of silver and of gold.

And the Lord will give favour to his people in the sight of the Egyptians. And Moses was a very great man in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and of all the people.
Dabit autem Dominus gratiam populo coram Aegyptiis. Fuitque Moyses vir magnus valde in terra Aegypti coram servis pharaonis et omni populo.
And he said: Thus saith the Lord: At midnight I will enter into Egypt. And every firstborn in the land of the Egyptians shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth on his throne, even to the firstborn of the handmaid that is at the mill, and all the firstborn of beasts.
Et ait Moyses: Hæc dicit Dominus: "Media nocte egrediar in Aegyptum; et morietur omne primogenitum in terra Aegyptiorum, a primogenito pharaonis, qui sedet in solio eius, usque ad primogenitum ancillæ, quæ est ad molam, et omnia primogenita iumentorum."
And there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as neither hath been before, nor shall be hereafter.
Eritque clamor magnus in universa terra Aegypti, qualis nec ante fuit nec postea futurus est.
But with all the children of Israel there shall not a dog make the least noise, from man even to beast; that you may know how wonderful a difference the Lord maketh between the Egyptians and Israel.
Apud omnes autem filios Israel non mutiet canis contra hominem et pecus, ut sciatis quanto miraculo dividat Dominus Aegyptios et Israel.
And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and shall worship me, saying: Go forth thou, and all the people that is under thee: after that we will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh exceeding angry.
Descendentque omnes servi tui isti ad me et adorabunt me dicentes: "Egredere tu et omnis populus, qui sequitur te. Post hæc egrediar." Et exivit a pharaone iratus nimis.
But the Lord said to Moses: Pharaoh will not hear you, that many signs may be done in the land of Egypt.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Non audiet vos pharao, ut multa signa fiant in terra Aegypti.
And Moses and Aaron did all the wonders that are written, before Pharaoh. And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, neither did he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Moyses autem et Aaron fecerunt omnia ostenta hæc coram pharaone; et induravit Dominus cor pharaonis, nec dimisit filios Israel de terra sua.
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall be to you the beginning of months; it shall be the first in the months of the year.
Dixit Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron in terra Aegypti: Mensis iste vobis principium mensium, primus erit in mensibus anni.
Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day of this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses.
Loquimini ad universum cœtum filiorum Israel et dicite eis: Decima die mensis huius tollat unusquisque agnum per familias et domos suas.
But if the number be less than may suffice to eat the lamb, he shall take unto him his neighbour that joineth to his house, according to the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb.
Sin autem minor est numerus, ut sufficere possit ad vescendum agnum, assumet vicinum suum, qui iunctus est domui suæ, iuxta numerum animarum, quæ sufficere possunt ad esum agni.
And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a male, of one year; according to which rite also you shall take a kid. And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall sacrifice it in the evening.
Erit autem vobis agnus absque macula, masculus, anniculus; quem de agnis vel hædis tolletis et servabitis eum usque ad quartam decimam diem mensis huius; immolabitque eum universa congregatio filiorum Israel ad vesperam.
And they shall take of the blood thereof, and put it upon both the side posts, and on the upper door posts of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettuce.
Et sument de sanguine eius ac ponent super utrumque postem et in superliminaribus domorum, in quibus comedent illum; et edent carnes nocte illa assas igni et azymos panes cum lactucis amaris.

You shall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled in water, but only roasted at the fire; you shall eat the head with the feet and entrails thereof.
Non comedetis ex eo crudum quid nec coctum aqua, sed tantum assum igni; caput cum pedibus eius et intestinis vorabitis.
Neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning. If there be any thing left, you shall burn it with fire.
Nec remanebit quidquam ex eo usque mane; si quid residuum fuerit, igne comburetis.
And thus you shall eat it: you shall gird your reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your hands, and you shall eat in haste; for it is the Phase (that is the Passage) of the Lord.
Sic autem comedetis illum: renes vestros accingetis, calceamenta habebitis in pedibus, tenentes baculos in manibus, et comedetis festinanter; est enim Pascha (id est Transitus) Domini!
And I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and will kill every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments; I am the Lord.
Et transibo per terram Aegypti nocte illa percutiamque omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti ab homine usque ad pecus; et in cunctis diis Aegypti faciam iudicia, ego Dominus.
And the blood shall be unto you for a sign in the houses where you shall be; and I shall see the blood, and shall pass over you; and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I shall strike the land of Egypt.
Erit autem sanguis vobis in signum in ædibus, in quibus eritis; et videbo sanguinem et transibo vos, nec erit in vobis plaga disperdens, quando percussero terram Aegypti.
Read it again and again.
Lege hoc iterum atque iterum.
And this day shall be for a memorial to you; and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord in your generations, with an everlasting observance.
Habebitis autem hanc diem in monumentum et celebrabitis eam sollemnem Domino in generationibus vestris cultu sempiterno.
Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread: in the first day there shall be no leaven in your houses; whosoever shall eat any thing leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall perish out of Israel.
Septem diebus azyma comedetis. Iam in die primo non erit fermentum in domibus vestris; quicumque comederit fermentatum, a primo die usque ad diem septimum, peribit anima illa de Israel.
The first day shall be holy and solemn, and the seventh day shall be kept with the like solemnity: you shall do no work in them, except those things that belong to eating.
Dies prima erit sancta atque sollemnis, et dies septima eadem festivitate venerabilis. Nihil operis facietis in eis, exceptis his, quæ ad vescendum pertinent.
And you shall observe the feast of the unleavened bread: for in this same day I will bring forth your army out of the land of Egypt, and you shall keep this day in your generations by a perpetual observance.
Et observabitis azyma, in eadem enim ipsa die eduxi exercitum vestrum de terra Aegypti; et custodietis diem istum in generationes vestras ritu perpetuo.
The first month, the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the same month, in the evening.
Primo mense, quarta decima die mensis ad vesperam comedetis azyma; usque ad diem vicesimam primam eiusdem mensis ad vesperam.
Seven days there shall not be found any leaven in your houses: he that shall eat leavened bread, his soul shall perish out of the assembly of Israel, whether he be a stranger or born in the land.
Septem diebus fermentum non invenietur in domibus vestris. Qui comederit fermentatum, peribit anima eius de cœtu Israel, tam de advenis quam de indigenis terræ.
You shall not eat any thing leavened: in all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.
Omne fermentatum non comedetis; in cunctis habitaculis vestris edetis azyma.
And Moses called all the ancients of the children of Israel, and said to them: Go take a lamb by your families, and sacrifice the Phase.
Vocavit autem Moyses omnes seniores filiorum Israel et dixit ad eos: Ite tollentes animal per familias vestras et immolate Pascha.
And dip a bunch of hyssop in the blood that is at the door, and sprinkle the transom of the door therewith, and both the door cheeks: let none of you go out of the door of his house till morning.
Fasciculumque hyssopi tingite in sanguine, qui est in pelvi, et aspergite ex eo superliminare et utrumque postem. Nullus vestrum egrediatur ostium domus suæ usque mane.
For the Lord will pass through striking the Egyptians: and when he shall see the blood on the transom, and on both the posts, he will pass over the door of the house, and not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses and to hurt you.
Transibit enim Dominus percutiens Aegyptios; cumque viderit sanguinem in superliminari et in utroque poste, transcendet ostium et non sinet percussorem ingredi domos vestras et lædere.
Thou shalt keep this thing as a law for thee and thy children for ever.
Custodite verbum istud legitimum tibi et filiis tuis usque in æternum.
And when you have entered into the land which the Lord will give you, as he hath promised, you shall observe these ceremonies.
Cumque introieritis terram, quam Dominus daturus est vobis, ut pollicitus est, observabitis cæremonias istas.
And when your children shall say to you: What is the meaning of this service? You shall say to them: It is the victim of the passage of the Lord, when he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, striking the Egyptians, and saving our houses. And the people bowing themselves, adored.
Et, cum dixerint vobis filii vestri: "Quæ est ista religio?", dicetis eis: "Victima Paschæ Domino est, quando transivit super domos filiorum Israel in Aegypto percutiens Aegyptios et domos nostras liberans". Incurvatusque populus adoravit.
And the children of Israel going forth, did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Et egressi filii Israel fecerunt, sicut præceperat Dominus Moysi et Aaron.
And it came to pass at midnight, the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive woman that was in the prison, and all the firstborn of cattle.
Factum est autem in noctis medio, percussit Dominus omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, a primogenito pharaonis, qui in solio eius sedebat, usque ad primogenitum captivi, qui erat in carcere, et omne primogenitum iumentorum.
And Pharaoh arose in the night, and all his servants, and all Egypt: and there arose a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house wherein there lay not one dead.
Surrexitque pharao nocte et omnes servi eius cunctaque Aegyptus, et ortus est clamor magnus in Aegypto, neque enim erat domus, in qua non iaceret mortuus.
And Pharaoh calling Moses and Aaron, in the night, said: Arise and go forth from among my people, you and the children of Israel: go, sacrifice to the Lord as you say.
Vocatisque pharao Moyse et Aaron nocte, ait: Surgite, egredimini a populo meo, vos et filii Israel; ite, immolate Domino, sicut dicitis.
Your sheep and herds take along with you, as you demanded, and departing bless me.
Oves vestras et armenta assumite, ut petieratis, et abeuntes benedicite mihi.
And the Egyptians pressed the people to go forth out of the land speedily, saying: We shall all die.
Urgebantque Aegyptii populum de terra exire velociter dicentes: Omnes moriemur.
The people therefore took dough before it was leavened; and tying it in their cloaks, put it on their shoulders.
Tulit igitur populus conspersam farinam, antequam fermentaretur; et ligans pistrina in palliis suis posuit super umeros suos.
And the children of Israel did as Moses had commanded: and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver and gold, and very much raiment.
Feceruntque filii Israel, sicut præceperat Moyses, et petierunt ab Aegyptiis vasa argentea et aurea vestemque plurimam.
And the Lord gave favour to the people in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them: and they stripped the Egyptians.
Dominus autem dedit gratiam populo coram Aegyptiis, ut commodarent eis; et spoliaverunt Aegyptios.
And the children of Israel set forward from Ramesse to Socoth, being about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children.
Profectique sunt filii Israel de Ramesse in Succoth, sescenta fere milia peditum virorum absque parvulis.
And a mixed multitude, without number, went up also with them, sheep and herds, and beasts of divers kinds, exceeding many.
Sed et vulgus promiscuum innumerabile ascendit cum eis, oves et armenta, animantia multa nimis.
And they baked the meal, which a little before they had brought out of Egypt in dough: and they made hearth cakes unleavened: for it could not be leavened, the Egyptians pressing them to depart, and not suffering them to make any stay; neither did they think of preparing any meat.
Coxeruntque farinam, quam dudum de Aegypto conspersam tulerant, et fecerunt subcinericios panes azymos; neque enim poterant fermentari, cogentibus exire Aegyptiis et nullam facere sinentibus moram; nec pulmenti quidquam occurrerant præparare.
And the abode of the children of Israel that they made in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
Habitatio autem filiorum Israel, qua manserant in Aegypto, fuit quadringentorum triginta annorum.
Which being expired, the same day all the army of the Lord went forth out of the land of Egypt.
Quibus expletis, eadem die egressus est omnis exercitus Domini de terra Aegypti.
This is the observable night of the Lord, when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: this night all the children of Israel must observe in their generations.
Nox ista vigiliarum Domino, quando eduxit eos de terra Aegypti: hanc observare debent Domino omnes filii Israel in generationibus suis.
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the service of the Phase; no foreigner shall eat of it. But every bought servant shall be circumcised, and so shall eat. The stranger and the hireling shall not eat thereof.
Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron: Hæc est religio Paschæ: Omnis alienigena non comedet ex eo; omnis autem servus empticius circumcidetur et sic comedet; advena et mercennarius non edent ex eo.
You're sad.
Tristis es.
In one house shall it be eaten, neither shall you carry forth of the flesh thereof out of the house, neither shall you break a bone thereof.
In una domo comedetur, nec efferetis de carnibus eius foras nec os illius confringetis.
Do you have a garden?
Habesne hortum?
All the assembly of the children of Israel shall keep it.
Omnis cœtus filiorum Israel faciet illud.
And if any stranger be willing to dwell among you, and to keep the Phase of the Lord, all his males shall first be circumcised, and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner: and he shall be as he that is born in the land: but if any man be uncircumcised, he shall not eat thereof.
Quod si quis peregrinorum in vestram voluerit transire coloniam et facere Pascha Domini, circumcidetur prius omne masculinum eius, et tunc rite celebrabit eritque sicut indigena terræ; si quis autem circumcisus non fuerit, non vescetur ex eo.
The same law shall be to him that is born in the land, and to the proselyte that sojourneth with you.
Eadem lex erit indigenæ et colono, qui peregrinatur apud vos.
And all the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron. And the same day the Lord brought forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies.
Feceruntque omnes filii Israel, sicut præceperat Dominus Moysi et Aaron; et in eadem die eduxit Dominus filios Israel de terra Aegypti per turmas suas.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Sanctify unto me every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel, as well of men as of beasts: for they are all mine.
Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen dicens: Sanctifica mihi omne primogenitum, quod aperit vulvam in filiis Israel, tam de hominibus quam de iumentis: mea sunt enim omnia.
And Moses said to the people: Remember this day in which you came forth out of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage, for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought you forth out of this place: that you eat no leavened bread.
Et ait Moyses ad populum: Mementote diei huius, in qua egressi estis de Aegypto et de domo servitutis, quoniam in manu forti eduxit vos Dominus de loco isto, ut non comedatis fermentatum panem.
This day you go forth in the month of new corn.
Hodie egredimini, mense Abib (id est novarum Frugum).
And when the Lord shall have brought thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to thy fathers that he would give thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey, thou shalt celebrate this manner of sacred rites in this month.
Cumque introduxerit te Dominus in terram Chananæi et Hetthæi et Amorræi et Hevæi et Iebusæi, quam iuravit patribus tuis, ut daret tibi, terram fluentem lacte et melle; celebrabis hunc morem sacrorum mense isto.
Marie is choosing the flowers.
Maria flores decerpit.
Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be the solemnity of the Lord.
Septem diebus vesceris azymis, et in die septimo erit sollemnitas Domini.
Unleavened bread shall you eat seven days: there shall not be seen any thing leavened with thee, nor in all thy coasts.
Azyma comedetis septem diebus: non apparebit apud te aliquid fermentatum nec in cunctis finibus tuis.
And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying: This is what the Lord did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.
Narrabisque filio tuo in die illo dicens: Propter hoc, quod fecit mihi Dominus, quando egressus sum de Aegypto.
And it shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a memorial before thy eyes; and that the law of the Lord be always in thy mouth, for with a strong hand the Lord hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
Et erit quasi signum in manu tua et quasi monumentum inter oculos tuos, ut lex Domini semper sit in ore tuo; in manu enim forti eduxit te Dominus de Aegypto.
Thou shalt keep this observance at the set time from days to days.
Custodies huiuscemodi cultum statuto tempore a diebus in dies.
And when the Lord shall have brought thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to thee and thy fathers, and shall give it thee: Thou shalt set apart all that openeth the womb for the Lord, and all that is first brought forth of thy cattle: whatsoever thou shalt have of the male sex, thou shalt consecrate to the Lord.
Cumque introduxerit te Dominus in terram Chananæi, sicut iuravit tibi et patribus tuis, et dederit tibi eam, separabis omne, quod aperit vulvam, Domino et quod primitivum est in pecoribus tuis; quidquid habueris masculini sexus, consecrabis Domino.
The firstborn of an ass thou shalt change for a sheep: and if thou do not redeem it, thou shalt kill it. And every firstborn of men thou shalt redeem with a price.
Primogenitum asini mutabis ove; quod, si non redemeris, interficies. Omne autem primogenitum hominis de filiis tuis pretio redimes.
Today, we're going dancing.
Hodie saltabimus.
And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow, saying: What is this? thou shalt answer him: With a strong hand did the Lord bring us forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. For when Pharaoh was hardened, and would not let us go, the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb of the male sex, and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.
Cumque interrogaverit te filius tuus cras dicens: "Quid est hoc?", respondebis ei: "In manu forti eduxit nos Dominus de Aegypto, de domo servitutis. Nam, cum induratus esset pharao et nollet nos dimittere, occidit Dominus omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, a primogenito hominis usque ad primogenitum iumentorum; idcirco immolo Domino omne, quod aperit vulvam, masculini sexus, et omnia primogenita filiorum meorum redimo".
And it shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a thing hung between thy eyes, for a remembrance: because the Lord hath brought us forth out of Egypt by a strong hand.
Erit igitur quasi signum in manu tua et quasi appensum quid ob recordationem inter oculos tuos, eo quod in manu forti eduxit nos Dominus de Aegypto.
And when Pharaoh had sent out the people, the Lord led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, which is near; thinking lest perhaps they would repent, if they should see wars arise against them, and would return into Egypt.But he led them about by the way of the desert, which is by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
Igitur cum emisisset pharao populum, non eos duxit Deus per viam terræ Philisthim, quæ vicina est, reputans ne forte pæniteret populum, si vidisset adversum se bella consurgere, et reverteretur in Aegyptum, sed circumduxit per viam deserti, quæ est iuxta mare Rubrum. Et armati ascenderunt filii Israel de terra Aegypti.
And Moses took Joseph's bones with him: because he had adjured the children of Israel, saying: God shall visit you, carry out my bones from hence with you.
Tulit quoque Moyses ossa Ioseph secum, eo quod adiurasset filios Israel dicens: Visitabit vos Deus; efferte ossa mea hinc vobiscum.
And marching from Socoth, they encamped in Etham, in the utmost coasts of the wilderness.
Profectique de Succoth castrametati sunt in Etham, in extremis finibus solitudinis.
And the Lord went before them to shew the way, by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire; that he might be the guide of their journey at both times.
Dominus autem præcedebat eos ad ostendendam viam per diem in columna nubis et per noctem in columna ignis, ut dux esset itineris utroque tempore.
There never failed the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, before the people.
Nunquam defuit columna nubis per diem, nec columna ignis per noctem, coram populo.
Why does nobody love me?
Cur nemo me amat?
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the children of Israel: Let them turn and encamp over against Phihahiroth, which is between Magdal and the sea over against Beelsephon: you shall encamp before it upon the sea.
Locutus est autem Dominus ad Moysen dicens: "Loquere filiis Israel: Reversi castrametentur e regione Phihahiroth, quæ est inter Magdolum et mare contra Beelsephon; in conspectu eius castra ponetis super mare."
And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel: They are straitened in the land, the desert hath shut them in.
Dicturusque est pharao super filiis Israel: Errant in terra, conclusit eos desertum.
And I shall harden his heart and he will pursue you: and I shall be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army: and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord.
Et indurabo cor eius, ac persequetur eos, et glorificabor in pharaone et in omni exercitu eius; scientque Aegyptii quia ego sum Dominus.
And they did so. And it was told the king of the Egyptians that the people was fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed with regard to the people, and they said: What meant we to do, that we let Israel go from serving us?
Feceruntque ita. Et nuntiatum est regi Aegyptiorum quod fugisset populus; immutatumque est cor pharaonis et servorum eius super populo, et dixerunt: Quid hoc fecimus, ut dimitteremus Israel, ne servirent nobis?
So he made ready his chariot, and took all his people with him. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots that were in Egypt: and the captains of the whole army.
Iunxit ergo currum et omnem populum suum assumpsit secum; tulitque sescentos currus electos et quidquid in Aegypto curruum fuit et bellatores in singulis curribus.
If I were rich, I'd travel.
Si dives essem, iter facerem.
If I were rich, I'd buy it.
Si dives essem, id emerem.
The bridge is high.
Pons altus est.
And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; but they were gone forth in a mighty hand.
Induravitque Dominus cor pharaonis regis Aegypti, et persecutus est filios Israel; at illi egressi erant in manu excelsa.
And when the Egyptians followed the steps of them who were gone before, they found them encamped at the sea side: all Pharaoh's horse and chariots and the whole army were in Phihahiroth, before Beelsephon.
Cumque persequerentur Aegyptii vestigia præcedentium, reppererunt eos in castris super mare; omnes equi et currus pharaonis, equites et exercitus eius erant in Phihahiroth contra Beelsephon.
And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifting up their eyes, saw the Egyptians behind them: and they feared exceedingly, and cried to the Lord. And they said to Moses: Perhaps there were no graves in Egypt, therefore thou hast brought us to die in the wilderness: why wouldst thou do this, to lead us out of Egypt?
Cumque appropinquasset pharao, levantes filii Israel oculos viderunt Aegyptios post se et timuerunt valde clamaveruntque ad Dominum et dixerunt ad Moysen: Forsitan non erant sepulcra in Aegypto? Ideo tulisti nos, ut moreremur in solitudine. Quid hoc fecisti, ut educeres nos ex Aegypto?
Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt, saying: Depart from us, that we may serve the Egyptians? for it was much better to serve them, than to die in the wilderness.
Nonne iste est sermo, quem loquebamur ad te in Aegypto dicentes: Recede a nobis, ut serviamus Aegyptiis? Multo enim melius erat servire eis quam mori in solitudine.
And Moses said to the people: Fear not: stand, and see the great wonders of the Lord, which he will do this day; for the Egyptians, whom you see now, you shall see no more for ever.
Et ait Moyses ad populum: Nolite timere; state et videte salutem Domini, quam facturus est vobis hodie; Aegyptios enim, quos nunc videtis, nequaquam ultra videbitis usque in sempiternum.
The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.
Dominus pugnabit pro vobis, et vos silebitis.
And the Lord said to Moses: Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel to go forward.
Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen: Quid clamas ad me? Loquere filiis Israel, ut proficiscantur.
But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and divide it: that the children of Israel may go through the midst of the sea on dry ground.
Tu autem eleva virgam tuam et extende manum tuam super mare et divide illud, ut gradiantur filii Israel in medio mari per siccum.
And I will harden the heart of the Egyptians to pursue you: and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his host, and in his chariots and in his horsemen.
Ego autem indurabo cor Aegyptiorum, ut persequantur eos; et glorificabor in pharaone et in omni exercitu eius, in curribus et in equitibus illius.
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall be glorified in Pharaoh, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen.
Et scient Aegyptii quia ego sum Dominus, cum glorificatus fuero in pharaone, in curribus atque in equitibus eius.
And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removing, went behind them: and together with him the pillar of the cloud, leaving the forepart, stood behind, between the Egyptians' camp and the camp of Israel: and it was a dark cloud, and enlightening the night, so that they could not come at one another all the night.
Tollensque se angelus Dei, qui præcedebat castra Israel, abiit post eos; et cum eo pariter columna nubis, priora dimittens, post tergum. Stetit inter castra Aegyptiorum et castra Israel; et erat nubes tenebrosa et illuminans noctem, ita ut ad se invicem toto noctis tempore accedere non valerent.
And when Moses had stretched forth his hand over the sea, the Lord took it away by a strong and burning wind blowing all the night, and turned it into dry ground: and the water was divided.
Cumque extendisset Moyses manum super mare, reppulit illud Dominus, flante vento vehementi et urente tota nocte, et vertit in siccum; divisaque est aqua.
And the children of Israel went in through the midst of the sea dried up; for the water was as a wall on their right hand and on their left.
Et ingressi sunt filii Israel per medium maris sicci; erat enim aqua quasi murus a dextra eorum et læva.
And the Egyptians pursuing went in after them, and all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and horsemen, through the midst of the sea.
Persequentesque Aegyptii ingressi sunt post eos, omnis equitatus pharaonis, currus eius et equites per medium maris.
And now the morning watch was come, and behold the Lord looking upon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, slew their host.
Iamque advenerat vigilia matutina, et ecce respiciens Dominus super castra Aegyptiorum per columnam ignis et nubis perturbavit exercitum eorum.
And overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were carried into the deep. And the Egyptians said: Let us flee from Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against us.
Et impedivit rotas curruum, ita ut difficile moverentur. Dixerunt ergo Aegyptii: Fugiamus Israelem! Dominus enim pugnat pro eis contra nos.
And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and horsemen.
Et ait Dominus ad Moysen: Extende manum tuam super mare, ut revertantur aquæ ad Aegyptios super currus et equites eorum.
And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea, it returned at the first break of day to the former place: and as the Egyptians were fleeing away, the waters came upon them, and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the waves.
Cumque extendisset Moyses manum contra mare, reversum est primo diluculo ad priorem locum; fugientibusque Aegyptiis occurrerunt aquæ, et involvit eos Dominus in mediis fluctibus.
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharaoh, who had come into the sea after them, neither did there so much as one of them remain.
Reversæque sunt aquæ et operuerunt currus et equites cuncti exercitus pharaonis, qui sequentes ingressi fuerant mare; ne unus quidem superfuit ex eis.
But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea upon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand and on the left.
Filii autem Israel perrexerunt per medium sicci maris, et aquæ eis erant quasi pro muro a dextris et a sinistris.
And the Lord delivered Israel in that day out of the hands of the Egyptians.
Liberavitque Dominus in die illo Israel de manu Aegyptiorum.
And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the mighty hand that the Lord had used against them: and the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord, and Moses his servant.
Et viderunt Aegyptios mortuos super litus maris et manum magnam, quam exercuerat Dominus contra eos; timuitque populus Dominum et crediderunt Domino et Moysi servo eius.
Then Moses and the children of Israel sung this canticle to the Lord, and said: Let us sing to the Lord: for he is gloriously magnified, the horse and the rider he hath thrown into the sea.
Tunc cecinit Moyses et filii Israel carmen hoc Domino, et dixerunt: Cantemus Domino, gloriose enim magnificatus est: equum et ascensorem eius deiecit in mare!
Now we are afraid of the paradise we created.
nunc paradīsum, ā nōbīs creātum, timēmus.
The Lord is my strength and my praise, and he is become salvation to me.
Fortitudo mea et robur meum Dominus, et factus est mihi in salutem.
He is my God, and I will glorify him: the God of my father, and I will exalt him.
Iste Deus meus, et glorificabo eum; Deus patris mei, et exaltabo eum!
The Lord is as a man of war, Almighty is his name.
Dominus quasi vir pugnator; Dominus nomen eius!
Pharaoh's chariots and his army he hath cast into the sea: his chosen captains are drowned in the Red Sea.
Currus pharaonis et exercitum eius proiecit in mare; electi bellatores eius submersi sunt in mari Rubro.
The depths have covered them, they are sunk to the bottom like a stone.
Abyssi operuerunt eos, descenderunt in profundum quasi lapis.
Thy right hand, O Lord, is magnified in strength: thy right hand, O Lord, hath slain the enemy.
Dextera tua, Domine, magnifice in fortitudine, dextera tua, Domine, percussit inimicum.
And in the multitude of thy glory thou hast put down thy adversaries: thou hast sent thy wrath, which hath devoured them like stubble.
Et in multitudine gloriæ tuæ deposuisti adversarios tuos; misisti iram tuam, quæ devoravit eos sicut stipulam.
And with the blast of thy anger the waters were gathered together: the flowing water stood, the depths were gathered together in the midst of the sea.
Et in spiritu furoris tui congregatæ sunt aquæ; stetit ut agger unda fluens, coagulatæ sunt abyssi in medio mari.
The enemy said: I will pursue and overtake, I will divide the spoils, my soul shall have its fill: I will draw my sword, my hand shall slay them.
Dixit inimicus: Persequar, comprehendam, dividam spolia, implebitur anima mea; evaginabo gladium meum, interficiet eos manus mea!
Thy wind blew and the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.
Flavit spiritus tuus, et operuit eos mare; submersi sunt quasi plumbum in aquis vehementibus.
Who is like to thee, among the gods, O Lord? who is like to thee, glorious in holiness, terrible and praise-worthy, doing wonders?
Quis similis tui in diis, Domine? Quis similis tui, magnificus in sanctitate, terribilis atque laudabilis, faciens mirabilia?
Thou stretchedst forth thy hand, and the earth swallowed them.
Extendisti manum tuam, devoravit eos terra.
In thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people which thou hast redeemed: and in thy strength thou hast carried them to thy holy habitation.
Dux fuisti in misericordia tua populo, quem redemisti, et portasti eum in fortitudine tua ad habitaculum sanctum tuum.
Nations rose up, and were angry: sorrows took hold on the inhabitants of Philisthiim.
Attenderunt populi et commoti sunt, dolores obtinuerunt habitatores Philisthææ.
Then were the princes of Edom troubled, trembling seized on the stout men of Moab: all the inhabitants of Canaan became stiff.
Tunc conturbati sunt principes Edom, potentes Moab obtinuit tremor, obriguerunt omnes habitatores Chanaan.
Let fear and dread fall upon them, in the greatness of thy arm: let them become immoveable as a stone, until thy people, O Lord, pass by: until this thy people pass by, which thou hast possessed.
Irruit super eos formido et pavor; in magnitudine brachii tui fiunt immobiles quasi lapis, donec pertranseat populus tuus, Domine, donec pertranseat populus tuus iste, quem possedisti.
I know that Tom is a very strong man.
Scio Thomam valde fortem esse.
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in thy most firm habitation, which thou hast made, O Lord; thy sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
Introduces eos et plantabis in monte hereditatis tuæ, firmissimo habitaculo tuo, quod operatus es, Domine, sanctuario, Domine, quod firmaverunt manus tuæ.
The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.
Dominus regnabit in æternum et ultra!
For Pharaoh went in on horseback with his chariots and horsemen into the sea: and the Lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea: but the children of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst thereof.
Ingressi sunt enim equi pharaonis cum curribus et equitibus eius in mare, et reduxit super eos Dominus aquas maris; filii autem Israel ambulaverunt per siccum in medio eius.
So Mary the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand: and all the women went forth after her with timbrels and with dances.
Sumpsit ergo Maria prophetissa soror Aaron tympanum in manu sua; egressæque sunt omnes mulieres post eam cum tympanis et choris.
And she began the song to them, saying: Let us sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously magnified, the horse and his rider he hath thrown into the sea.
Quibus præcinebat dicens: Cantemus Domino, gloriose enim magnificatus est: equum et ascensorem eius deiecit in mare!
And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went forth into the wilderness of Sur: and they marched three days through the wilderness, and found no water.
Tulit autem Moyses Israel de mari Rubro, et egressi sunt in desertum Sur; ambulaveruntque tribus diebus per solitudinem et non inveniebant aquam.
And they came into Mara, and they could not drink the waters of Mara because they were bitter: whereupon he gave a name also agreeable to the place, calling it Mara, that is, bitterness.
Et venerunt in Mara nec poterant bibere aquas de Mara, eo quod essent amaræ; unde vocatum est nomen eius Mara (id est Amaritudo).
And the people murmured against Moses, saying: What shall we drink?
Et murmuravit populus contra Moysen dicens: Quid bibemus?
But he cried to the Lord, and he shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, they were turned into sweetness.
At ille clamavit ad Dominum, qui ostendit ei lignum; quod cum misisset in aquas, in dulcedinem versæ sunt.
There he appointed him ordinances, and judgments, and there he proved him, saying: If thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and do what is right before him, and obey his commandments, and keep all his precepts, none of the evils that I laid upon Egypt, will I bring upon thee: for I am the Lord thy healer.
Ibi constituit ei præcepta atque iudicia et ibi tentavit eum dicens: Si audieris vocem Domini Dei tui et, quod rectum est coram eo, feceris et obœdieris mandatis eius custodierisque omnia præcepta illius, cunctum languorem, quem posui in Aegypto, non inducam super te: Ego enim Dominus sanator tuus.
And the children of Israel came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped by the waters.
Venerunt autem in Elim, ubi erant duodecim fontes aquarum et septuaginta palmæ; et castrametati sunt iuxta aquas.
And they set forward from Elim, and all the multitude of the children of Israel came into the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai: the fifteenth day of the second month, after they came out of the land of Egypt.
Profectique sunt de Elim, et venit omnis congregatio filiorum Israel in desertum Sin, quod est inter Elim et Sinai, quinto decimo die mensis secundi postquam egressi sunt de terra Aegypti.
And all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
Et murmuravit omnis congregatio filiorum Israel contra Moysen et Aaron in solitudine.
And the children of Israel said to them: Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat over the fleshpots, and ate bread to the full: Why have you brought us into this desert, that you might destroy all the multitude with famine?
Dixeruntque filii Israel ad eos: Utinam mortui essemus per manum Domini in terra Aegypti, quando sedebamus super ollas carnium et comedebamus panem in saturitate. Cur eduxistis nos in desertum istud, ut occideretis omnem cœtum fame?
And the Lord said to Moses: Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you; let the people go forth, and gather what is sufficient for every day: that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law, or not.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Ecce ego pluam vobis panes de cælo; egrediatur populus et colligat, quæ sufficiunt per singulos dies, ut tentem eum, utrum ambulet in lege mea an non.
But the sixth day let them provide for to bring in: and let it be double to that they were wont to gather every day.
Die autem sexta parabunt quod intulerint, et duplum erit quam colligere solebant per singulos dies.
And Moses and Aaron said to the children of Israel: In the evening you shall know that the Lord hath brought you forth out of the land of Egypt: And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord.
Dixeruntque Moyses et Aaron ad omnes filios Israel: Vespere scietis quod Dominus eduxerit vos de terra Aegypti; et mane videbitis gloriam Domini.
For he hath heard your murmuring against the Lord: but as for us, what are we, that you mutter against us?
Audivit enim murmur vestrum contra Dominum. Nos vero quid sumus, quia mussitatis contra nos?
And Moses said: In the evening the Lord will give you flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full: for he hath heard your murmurings, with which you have murmured against him, for what are we? your murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord.
Et ait Moyses: Dabit Dominus vobis vespere carnes edere et mane panes in saturitate, eo quod audierit murmurationes vestras, quibus murmurati estis contra eum. Nos enim quid sumus? Nec contra nos est murmur vestrum, sed contra Dominum.
We're coming at once.
Statim venimus.
We're having lunch.
Prandium sumimus.
Moses also said to Aaron: Say to the whole congregation of the children of Israel: Come before the Lord; for he hath heard your murmuring.
Dixitque Moyses ad Aaron: Dic universæ congregationi filiorum Israel: Accedite coram Domino; audivit enim murmur vestrum.
And when Aaron spoke to all the assembly of the children of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness; and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.
Cumque loqueretur Aaron ad omnem cœtum filiorum Israel, respexerunt ad solitudinem, et ecce gloria Domini apparuit in nube.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel, say to them: In the evening you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God.
Locutus est autem Dominus ad Moysen dicens: Audivi murmurationes filiorum Israel. Loquere ad eos: Vespere comedetis carnes et mane saturabimini panibus scietisque quod ego sum Dominus Deus vester.
So it came to pass in the evening, that quails coming up, covered the camp: and in the morning a dew lay round about the camp.
Factum est ergo vespere, et ascendens coturnix operuit castra; mane quoque ros iacuit per circuitum castrorum.
And when it had covered the face of the earth, it appeared in the wilderness small, and as it were beaten with a pestle, like unto the hoar frost on the ground.
Cumque operuisset superficiem deserti, apparuit minutum et squamatum in similitudinem pruinæ super terram.
And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another: Manhu! which signifieth: What is this! for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them: This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.
Quod cum vidissent filii Israel, dixerunt ad invicem: "Manhu?” (quod significat: “Quid est hoc?”). Ignorabant enim quid esset. Quibus ait Moyses: “Iste est panis, quem dedit Dominus vobis ad vescendum."
This is the word that the Lord hath commanded: Let every one gather of it as much as is enough to eat; a gomor for every man, according to the number of your souls that dwell in a tent, so shall you take of it.
Hic est sermo, quem præcepit Dominus: Colligat ex eo unusquisque quantum sufficiat ad vescendum; gomor per singula capita iuxta numerum animarum vestrarum, quæ habitant in tabernaculo, sic tolletis.
Do you want to dance?
Visne saltare?
We're boys.

And the children of Israel did so: and they gathered, one more, another less.
Feceruntque ita filii Israel; et collegerunt alius plus, alius minus.
And they measured by the measure of a gomor: neither had he more that had gathered more; nor did he find less that had provided less: but every one had gathered, according to what they were able to eat.
Et mensi sunt ad mensuram gomor; nec qui plus collegerat, habuit amplius, nec qui minus paraverat, repperit minus, sed singuli, iuxta id quod edere poterant, congregaverunt.
And Moses said to them: Let no man leave thereof till the morning.
Dixitque Moyses ad eos: Nullus relinquat ex eo in mane.
And they hearkened not to him, but some of them left until the morning, and it began to be full of worms, and it putrified, and Moses was angry with them.
Qui non audierunt eum, sed dimiserunt quidam ex eis usque mane, et scatere cœpit vermibus atque computruit; et iratus est contra eos Moyses.
Now every one of them gathered in the morning, as much as might suffice to eat: and after the sun grew hot, it melted.
Colligebant autem mane singuli, quantum sufficere poterat ad vescendum; cumque incaluisset sol, liquefiebat.
But on the sixth day they gathered twice as much, that is, two gomors every man: and all the rulers of the multitude came, and told Moses.
In die autem sexta collegerunt cibos duplices, id est duo gomor per singulos homines. Venerunt autem omnes principes congregationis et narraverunt Moysi.
And he said to them: This is what the Lord hath spoken: To morrow is the rest of the sabbath sanctified to the Lord. Whatsoever work is to be done, do it; and the meats that are to be dressed, dress them; and whatsoever shall remain, lay it up until the morning.
Qui ait eis: Hoc est quod locutus est Dominus: Requies, sabbatum sanctum Domino cras; quodcumque torrendum est, torrete et, quæ coquenda sunt, coquite; quidquid autem reliquum fuerit, reponite usque in mane.
And they did so as Moses had commanded, and it did not putrify, neither was there worm found in it.
Feceruntque ita, ut præceperat Moyses, et non computruit, neque vermis inventus est in eo.
And Moses said: Eat it to day, because it is the sabbath of the Lord: to day it shall not be found in the field.
Dixitque Moyses: Comedite illud hodie, quia sabbatum est Domino; non invenietur hodie in agro.
Gather it six days; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord, therefore it shall not be found.
Sex diebus colligite; in die autem septimo sabbatum est Domino, idcirco non invenietur in eo.
And the seventh day came; and some of the people going forth to gather, found none.
Venitque septima dies; et egressi de populo, ut colligerent, non invenerunt.
And the Lord said to Moses: How long will you refuse to keep my commandments, and my law?
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Usquequo non vultis custodire mandata mea et legem meam?
See that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, and for this reason on the sixth day he giveth you a double provision: let each man stay at home, and let none go forth out of his place the seventh day.
Videte quod Dominus dederit vobis sabbatum et propter hoc die sexta tribuit vobis cibos duplices; maneat unusquisque apud semetipsum, nullus egrediatur de loco suo die septimo.
And the people kept the sabbath on the seventh day.
Et sabbatizavit populus die septimo.
And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste thereof like to flour with honey.
Appellavitque domus Israel nomen eius Man: quod erat quasi semen coriandri album, gustusque eius quasi similæ cum melle.
And Moses said: This is the word which the Lord hath commanded: Fill a gomor of it, and let it be kept unto generations to come hereafter; that they may know the bread, wherewith I fed you in the wilderness when you were brought forth out of the land of Egypt.
Dixit autem Moyses: Iste est sermo, quem præcepit Dominus: "Imple gomor ex eo, et custodiatur in generationes vestras, ut noverint panem, quo alui vos in solitudine, quando educti estis de terra Aegypti".
And Moses said to Aaron: Take a vessel, and put manna into it, as much as a gomor can hold; and lay it up before the Lord, to keep unto your generations.
Dixitque Moyses ad Aaron: Sume vas unum et mitte ibi man, quantum potest capere gomor; et repone coram Domino ad servandum in generationes vestras.
As the Lord commanded Moses. And Aaron put it in the tabernacle to be kept.
Sicut præcepit Dominus Moysi, posuit illud Aaron coram testimonio reservandum.
And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land: with this meat were they fed, until they reached the borders of the land of Canaan.
Filii autem Israel comederunt man quadraginta annis, donec venirent in terram habitabilem; hoc cibo aliti sunt, usquequo tangerent fines terræ Chanaan.
Now a gomor is the tenth part of an ephi.
Gomor autem decima pars est ephi.
Then all the multitude of the children of Israel setting forward from the desert of Sin, by their mansions, according to the word of the Lord, encamped in Raphidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
Igitur profecta omnis congregatio filiorum Israel de deserto Sin per mansiones suas iuxta sermonem Domini, castrametati sunt in Raphidim, ubi non erat aqua ad bibendum populo.
And they chode with Moses, and said: Give us water, that we may drink. And Moses answered them: Why chide you with me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?
Qui iurgatus contra Moysen ait: "Da nobis aquam, ut bibamus”. Quibus respondit Moyses: “Quid iurgamini contra me? Cur tentatis Dominum?”
So the people were thirsty there for want of water, and murmured against Moses, saying: Why didst thou make us go forth out of Egypt, to kill us and our children, and our beasts with thirst?
Sitivit ergo ibi populus præ aquæ penuria et murmuravit contra Moysen dicens: Cur fecisti nos exire de Aegypto, ut occideres nos et liberos nostros ac iumenta siti?
And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: What shall I do to this people? Yet a little more and they will stone me.
Clamavit autem Moyses ad Dominum dicens: Quid faciam populo huic? Adhuc paululum et lapidabunt me.
And the Lord said to Moses: Go before the people, and take with thee of the ancients of Israel: and take in thy hand the rod wherewith thou didst strike the river, and go.
Et ait Dominus ad Moysen: Antecede populum et sume tecum de senioribus Israel, et virgam, qua percussisti fluvium, tolle in manu tua et vade.
Behold I will stand there before thee, upon the rock Horeb, and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink. Moses did so before the ancients of Israel.
"En ego stabo coram te ibi super petram Horeb; percutiesque petram, et exibit ex ea aqua, ut bibat populus." Fecit Moyses ita coram senioribus Israel.
And he called the name of that place Temptation, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and for that they tempted the Lord, saying: Is the Lord amongst us or not?
Et vocavit nomen loci illius Massa et Meriba, propter iurgium filiorum Israel et quia tentaverunt Dominum dicentes: Estne Dominus in nobis an non?
And Amalec came, and fought against Israel in Raphidim.
Venit autem Amalec et pugnabat contra Israel in Raphidim.
We're building a bridge.
pontem aedificāmus.
We're building a bridge.
Pontem efficimus.
We're having breakfast.
Ientaculum sumimus.
We're expecting a baby.
Infantem exspectamus.
And Moses said to Josue: Choose out men; and go out and fight against Amalec: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill, having the rod of God in my hand.
Dixitque Moyses ad Iosue: Elige nobis viros et egressus pugna contra Amalec; cras ego stabo in vertice collis habens virgam Dei in manu mea.
How do you know I don't know?
Cur scis me nescire?
Josue did as Moses had spoken, and he fought against Amalec; but Moses, and Aaron, and Hur, went up upon the top of the hill.
Fecit Iosue, ut locutus erat ei Moyses, et pugnavit contra Amalec; Moyses autem et Aaron et Hur ascenderunt super verticem collis.
And when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel overcame; but if he let them down a little, Amalec overcame.
Cumque levaret Moyses manus, vincebat Israel; sin autem remisisset, superabat Amalec.
And Moses's hands were heavy: so they took a stone, and put under him, and he sat on it: and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands on both sides. And it came to pass, that his hands were not weary until sunset.
Manus autem Moysi erant graves; sumentes igitur lapidem posuerunt subter eum, in quo sedit; Aaron autem et Hur sustentabant manus eius ex utraque parte. Et factum est ut manus eius non lassarentur usque ad occasum solis.
And Josue put Amalec and his people to flight, by the edge of the sword.
Vicitque Iosue Amalec et populum eius in ore gladii.
And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in a book, and deliver it to the ears of Josue; for I will destroy the memory of Amalec from under heaven.
Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Scribe hoc ob monumentum in libro et trade auribus Iosue; delebo enim memoriam Amalec sub cælo.
And Moses built an altar; and called the name thereof, The Lord, my exaltation, saying: Because the hand of the throne of the Lord, and the war of the Lord shall be against Amalec, from generation to generation.
Aedificavitque Moyses altare et vocavit nomen eius Dominus Nissi (Dominus vexillum meum) dicens: Quia manus contra solium Domini: bellum Domino erit contra Amalec a generatione in generationem.
And when Jethro the priest of Madian, the kinsman of Moses, had heard all the things that God had done to Moses, and to Israel his people, and that the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt:
Cumque audisset Iethro sacerdos Madian socer Moysi omnia, quæ fecerat Deus Moysi et Israel populo suo, eo quod eduxisset Dominus Israel de Aegypto.
He took Sephora, the wife of Moses, whom he had sent back, and her two sons, of whom one was called Gersam: his father saying, I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And the other Eliezer: For the God of my father, said he, is my helper, and hath delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
Tulit Sephoram uxorem Moysi, quam remiserat, et duos filios eius, quorum unus vocabatur Gersam, dicente patre: “Advena fui in terra aliena”, alter vero Eliezer: “Deus enim, ait, patris mei adiutor meus, et eruit me de gladio pharaonis”.
And Jethro, the kinsman of Moses, came with his sons, and his wife to Moses into the desert, where he was camped by the mountain of God. And he sent word to Moses, saying: I Jethro, thy kinsman, come to thee, and thy wife, and thy two sons with her.
Venit ergo Iethro socer Moysi et filii eius et uxor eius ad Moysen in desertum, ubi erat castrametatus iuxta montem Dei; et mandavit Moysi dicens: Ego socer tuus Iethro venio ad te et uxor tua et duo filii tui cum ea.
And he went out to meet his kinsman, and worshipped and kissed him: and they saluted one another with words of peace.
Qui egressus in occursum soceri sui adoravit et osculatus est eum, salutaveruntque se mutuo verbis pacificis.
And when he was come into the tent, Moses told his kinsman all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh, and the Egyptians in favour of Israel: and all the labour which had befallen them in the journey, and that the Lord had delivered them.
Cumque intrasset tabernaculum, narravit Moyses socero suo cuncta, quæ fecerat Dominus pharaoni et Aegyptiis propter Israel, universumque laborem, qui accidisset eis in itinere, et quod liberaverat eos Dominus.
And Jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the Lord had done to Israel, because he had delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians.
Lætatusque est Iethro super omnibus bonis, quæ fecerat Dominus Israel, eo quod eruisset eum de manu Aegyptiorum.
And he said: Blessed is the Lord, who hath delivered his people out of the hand of Egypt.
Et ait: Benedictus Dominus, qui liberavit vos de manu Aegyptiorum et de manu pharaonis.
Now I know, that the Lord is great above all gods; because they dealt proudly against them.
Nunc cognovi quia magnus Dominus super omnes deos, eo quod eruerit populum de manu Aegyptiorum, qui superbe egerunt contra illos.
We're going to the country.
Ad campos imus.
We're going to the market.
Ad macellum ibimus.
We're in need of some food.
Cibo egemus.
So Jethro, the kinsman of Moses, offered holocausts and sacrifices to God: and Aaron and all the ancients of Israel came, to eat bread with him before God.
Obtulit ergo Iethro socer Moysi holocausta et hostias Deo; veneruntque Aaron et omnes seniores Israel, ut comederent panem cum eo coram Deo.
And the next day Moses sat to judge the people, who stood by Moses from morning until night.
Altero autem die sedit Moyses, ut iudicaret populum, qui assistebat Moysi de mane usque ad vesperam.
And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the people, he said: What is it that thou dost among the people? Why sittest thou alone, and all the people wait from morning till night?
Quod cum vidisset socer eius, omnia scilicet, quæ agebat in populo, ait: Quid est hoc, quod facis in plebe? Cur solus sedes, et omnis populus præstolatur de mane usque ad vesperam?
And Moses answered him: The people come to me to seek the judgment of God.
Cui respondit Moyses: Venit ad me populus quærens sententiam Dei.
And when any controversy falleth out among them, they come to me to judge between them, and to shew the precepts of God, and his laws.
Cumque acciderit eis aliqua disceptatio, veniunt ad me, ut iudicem inter eos et ostendam præcepta Dei et leges eius.
But he said: The thing thou dost is not good. Thou art spent with foolish labour, both thou, and this people that is with thee; the business is above thy strength, thou alone canst not bear it.
At ille: Non bonam, inquit, rem facis. Consumeris et tu et populus iste, qui tecum est. Ultra vires tuas est negotium; solus illud non poteris sustinere.
Give him a kiss.
Da osculum ei.
But hear my words and counsels, and God shall be with thee. Be thou to the people in those things that pertain to God, to bring their words to him, and to shew the people the ceremonies, and the manner of worshipping; and the way wherein they ought to walk, and the work that they ought to do.
Sed audi verba mea atque consilia, et erit Deus tecum: Esto tu populo in his, quæ ad Deum pertinent, ut referas causas ad Deum ostendasque populo præcepta et leges viamque, per quam ingredi debeant, et opus, quod facere debeant.
And provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, in whom there is truth, and that hate avarice, and appoint of them rulers of thousands, and of hundreds, and of fifties, and of tens.
Provide autem de omni plebe viros strenuos et timentes Deum, in quibus sit veritas, et qui oderint avaritiam, et constitue ex eis tribunos et centuriones et quinquagenarios et decanos.
Who may judge the people at all times: and when any great matter soever shall fall out, let them refer it to thee, and let them judge the lesser matters only: that so it may be lighter for thee, the burden being shared out unto others.
Qui iudicent populum omni tempore. Quidquid autem maius fuerit, referant ad te, et ipsi minora tantummodo iudicent; leviusque sit tibi, partito cum aliis onere.
If thou dost this, thou shalt fulfil the commandment of God, and shalt be able to bear his precepts: and all this people shall return to their places with peace.
Si hoc feceris, implebis imperium Dei et præcepta eius poteris sustentare, et omnis hic populus revertetur ad loca sua cum pace.
And when Moses heard this, he did all things that he had suggested unto him. And choosing able men out of all Israel, he appointed them rulers of the people, rulers over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens. And they judged the people at all times.
Quibus auditis, Moyses fecit omnia, quæ ille suggesserat; et, electis viris strenuis de cuncto Israel, constituit eos principes populi, tribunos et centuriones et quinquagenarios et decanos, qui iudicabant plebem omni tempore.
And whatsoever was of greater difficulty they referred to him, and they judged the easier cases only.
Quidquid autem gravius erat, referebant ad eum, faciliora tantummodo iudicantes.
And he let his kinsman depart: and he returned and went into his own country.
Dimisitque socerum suum, qui reversus abiit in terram suam.
In the third month of the departure of Israel out of the land of Egypt, on this day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
Mense tertio egressionis Israel de terra Aegypti, in die hac venerunt in solitudinem Sinai.
For departing out of Raphidim, and coming to the desert of Sinai, they camped in the same place, and there Israel pitched their tents over against the mountain.
Nam profecti de Raphidim et pervenientes usque in desertum Sinai, castrametati sunt in eodem loco, ibique Israel fixit tentoria e regione montis.
And Moses went up to God; and the Lord called unto him from the mountain, and said: Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: You have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, how I have carried you upon the wings of eagles, and have taken you to myself.
Moyses autem ascendit ad Deum, vocavitque eum Dominus de monte et ait: Hæc dices domui Iacob et annuntiabis filiis Israel: "Vos ipsi vidistis, quæ fecerim Aegyptiis, quomodo portaverim vos super alas aquilarum et adduxerim ad me."
If therefore you will hear my voice, and keep my covenant, you shall be my peculiar possession above all people: for all the earth is mine.
Si ergo audieritis vocem meam et custodieritis pactum meum, eritis mihi in peculium de cunctis populis; mea est enim omnis terra.
And you shall be to me a priestly kingdom, and a holy nation. These are the words thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.
"Et vos eritis mihi regnum sacerdotum et gens sancta." Hæc sunt verba, quæ loqueris ad filios Israel.
Moses came; and calling together the elders of the people, he declared all the words which the Lord had commanded.
Venit Moyses et, convocatis maioribus natu populi, exposuit omnes sermones, quos mandaverat Dominus.
And all the people answered together: All that the Lord hath spoken, we will do.
Responditque universus populus simul: Cuncta, quæ locutus est Dominus, faciemus.
And when Moses had related the people's words to the Lord, the Lord said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in the darkness of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may believe thee for ever.
Cumque rettulisset Moyses verba populi ad Dominum, ait ei Dominus: Ecce ego veniam ad te in caligine nubis, ut audiat me populus loquentem ad te et tibi quoque credat in perpetuum.
And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord. And he said to him: Go to the people, and sanctify them to day, and to morrow, and let them wash their garments.
Nuntiavit ergo Moyses verba populi ad Dominum, qui dixit ei: Vade ad populum et sanctifica illos hodie et cras; laventque vestimenta sua.
And let them be ready against the third day; for on the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people, upon Mount Sinai.
Et sint parati in diem tertium. In die enim tertio descendet Dominus coram omni plebe super montem Sinai.
And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about, and thou shalt say to them: Take heed ye go not up into the mount, and that ye touch not the borders thereof: every one that toucheth the mount, dying he shall die.
Constituesque terminos populo per circuitum et dices: Cavete, ne ascendatis in montem nec tangatis fines illius; omnis, qui tetigerit montem, morte morietur.
No hands shall touch him, but he shall be stoned to death, or he shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be beast, or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin to sound, then let them go up into the mount.
Manus non tanget eum, sed lapidibus opprimetur aut confodietur iaculis; sive iumentum fuerit, sive homo, non vivet. Cum cœperit clangere bucina, tunc ascendant in montem.
And Moses came down from the mount to the people, and sanctified them. And when they had washed their garments, he said to them: Be ready against the third day, and come not near your wives.
Descenditque Moyses de monte ad populum et sanctificavit eum; cumque lavissent vestimenta sua, ait ad eos: Estote parati in diem tertium; ne appropinquetis uxoribus vestris.
And now the third day was come, and the morning appeared: and behold thunders began to be heard, and lightning to flash, and a very thick cloud to cover the mount, and the noise of the trumpet sounded exceeding loud; and the people that was in the camp, feared.
Iamque advenerat tertius dies, et mane inclaruerat; et ecce cœperunt audiri tonitrua ac micare fulgura et nubes densissima operire montem, clangorque bucinæ vehementius perstrepebat; et timuit populus, qui erat in castris.
And when Moses had brought them forth to meet God, from the place of the camp, they stood at the bottom of the mount.
Cumque eduxisset eos Moyses in occursum Dei de loco castrorum, steterunt ad radices montis.
And all Mount Sinai was on a smoke: because the Lord was come down upon it in fire, and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace: and all the mount was terrible.
Totus autem mons Sinai fumabat, eo quod descendisset Dominus super eum in igne, et ascenderet fumus ex eo quasi de fornace. Et tremuit omnis mons vehementer.
And the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder and louder, and was drawn out to a greater length: Moses spoke, and God answered him.
Et sonitus bucinæ paulatim crescebat in maius; Moyses loquebatur, et Deus respondebat ei cum voce.
And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, in the very top of the mount, and he called Moses unto the top thereof.
Descenditque Dominus super montem Sinai in ipso montis vertice et vocavit Moysen in cacumen eius.
And when he was gone up thither, he said unto him: Go down, and charge the people; lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should perish.
Quo cum ascendisset, dixit ad eum: Descende et contestare populum, ne velit transcendere terminos ad videndum Dominum, et pereat ex eis plurima multitudo.
Tom is married and lives in Boston.
Thomas maritus est et Bostoni habitat.
The priests also that come to the Lord, let them be sanctified, lest he strike them.
Sacerdotes quoque, qui accedunt ad Dominum, sanctificentur, ne percutiat eos.
And Moses said to the Lord: The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai: for thou didst charge, and command, saying: Set limits about the mount, and sanctify it.
Dixitque Moyses ad Dominum: Non poterit vulgus ascendere in montem Sinai, tu enim testificatus es et iussisti dicens: "Pone terminos circa montem et sanctifica illum".
And the Lord said to him: Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people pass the limits, nor come up to the Lord, lest he kill them.
Cui ait Dominus: Vade, descende; ascendesque tu et Aaron tecum, sacerdotes autem et populus ne transeant terminos nec ascendant ad Dominum, ne interficiat illos.
And Moses went down to the people and told them all.
Descenditque Moyses ad populum et omnia narravit eis.
And the Lord spoke all these words: I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Locutusque est Deus cunctos sermones hos: Ego sum Dominus Deus tuus, qui eduxi te de terra Aegypti, de domo servitutis.
Thou shalt not have strange gods before me.
Non habebis deos alienos coram me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth.
Non facies tibi sculptile neque omnem similitudinem eorum, quæ sunt in cælo desuper et quæ in terra deorsum et quæ in aquis sub terra.
Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands to them that love me, and keep my commandments.
Non adorabis ea neque coles, quia ego sum Dominus Deus tuus, Deus zelotes, visitans iniquitatem patrum in filiis in tertiam et quartam generationem eorum, qui oderunt me, et faciens misericordiam in milia his, qui diligunt me et custodiunt præcepta mea.
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.
Non assumes nomen Domini Dei tui in vanum, nec enim habebit insontem Dominus eum, qui assumpserit nomen Domini Dei sui frustra.
I've lost my wallet.
Sacculum meum amisi.
Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day.
Memento, ut diem sabbati sanctifices.
Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works. But on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work on it, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.
Sex diebus operaberis et facies omnia opera tua; septimus autem dies sabbatum Domino Deo tuo est; non facies omne opus tu et filius tuus et filia tua, servus tuus et ancilla tua, iumentum tuum et advena, qui est intra portas tuas.
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day: therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.
Sex enim diebus fecit Dominus cælum et terram et mare et omnia, quæ in eis sunt, et requievit in die septimo; idcirco benedixit Dominus diei sabbati et sanctificavit eum.
They had no food.
Cibum non habebant.
Honour thy father and thy mother, that thou mayst be longlived upon the land which the Lord thy God will give thee.
Honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam, ut sis longævus super terram, quam Dominus Deus tuus dabit tibi.
Thou shalt not kill.
Non occides.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Non mœchaberis.
Thou shalt not steal.
Non furtum facies.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
Non loqueris contra proximum tuum falsum testimonium.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; neither shalt thou desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.
Non concupisces domum proximi tui: non desiderabis uxorem eius, non servum, non ancillam, non bovem, non asinum nec omnia, quæ illius sunt.
And all the people saw the voices and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking; and being terrified and struck with fear, they stood afar off, saying to Moses: Speak thou to us, and we will hear: let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die.
Cunctus autem populus videbat voces et lampades et sonitum bucinæ montemque fumantem; et perterriti ac pavore concussi steterunt procul dicentes Moysi: Loquere tu nobis, et audiemus; non loquatur nobis Deus, ne moriamur.
And Moses said to the people: Fear not; for God is come to prove you, and that the dread of him might be in you, and you should not sin.
Et ait Moyses ad populum: Nolite timere; ut enim probaret vos, venit Deus, et ut timor illius esset in vobis, ne peccaretis.
And the people stood afar off. But Moses went to the dark cloud wherein God was.
Stetitque populus de longe; Moyses autem accessit ad caliginem, in qua erat Deus.
And the Lord said to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.
Dixit præterea Dominus ad Moysen: Hæc dices filiis Israel: "Vos vidistis quod de cælo locutus sim vobis."
I hope that I will see him tomorrow.
Spero me cras eum visurum esse.
You shall not make gods of silver, nor shall you make to yourselves gods of gold.
Non facietis præter me deos argenteos nec deos aureos facietis vobis.
You shall make an altar of earth unto me, and you shall offer upon it your holocausts and peace offerings, your sheep and oxen, in every place where the memory of my name shall be: I will come to thee, and will bless thee.
Altare de terra facietis mihi et offeretis super eo holocausta et pacifica vestra, oves vestras et boves; in omni loco, in quo memoriam fecero nominis mei, veniam ad te et benedicam tibi.
And if thou make an altar of stone unto me, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up a tool upon it, it shall be defiled.
Quod si altare lapideum feceris mihi, non ædificabis illud de sectis lapidibus; si enim levaveris cultrum super eo, polluetur.
Thou shalt not go up by steps unto my altar, lest thy nakedness be discovered.
Non ascendes per gradus ad altare meum, ne reveletur turpitudo tua.
These are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
Hæc sunt iudicia, quæ propones eis:
If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve thee; in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
Si emeris servum Hebræum, sex annis serviet tibi; in septimo egredietur liber gratis.
With what raiment he came in, with the like let him go out: if having a wife, his wife also shall go out with him.
Si solus intraverit, solus exeat; si habens uxorem, et uxor egredietur simul.
But if his master gave him a wife, and she hath borne sons and daughters; the woman and her children shall be her master's: but he himself shall go out with his raiment.
Sin autem dominus dederit illi uxorem, et pepererit filios et filias, mulier et liberi eius erunt domini sui; ipse vero exibit solus.

When an English speaker realises that a foreign person they are speaking to doesn't understand one of their sentences, they repeat it, the same way, but louder, as though the person were deaf. At no point does it come to their mind that their vocabulary might be complicated or that their expression might most probably be ambiguous to a foreigner and that they could reword it in a simpler way. The result is that not only does the person still not understand, but they get irritated at being considered deaf.

When a transformation has happened, it's not always reversible. However, sometimes a little change makes the transformation backwards possible. Thus, since a change is in this case a transformation as well, there might be needed a transformation to make it possible for the transformation that is the reverse of another transformation to happen.
Cum accidit transformatio, reverti non semper potest, nonnumquam tamen minori facto fit transformatio quae reverti potest. Factum minus igitur cum transformationis sit formae, aliam forsitan implicat transformationem ut fiat transformatio aliae reversae transformationis.

Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.

But I believe Aang can save the world.

Centum anni transierant, frater meus et ego novum Avatar invenimus, dominum aeris nomine Aang. Quamquam etiam dominandi aeris peritiae suae optimae sunt, antequam paratus sit ceteros servare, multa ei sunt discenda. Ego tamen credo Aang omnes servare posse.
